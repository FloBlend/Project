"2005-09-13	4.0	4	7	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  I LOVE LUDACRIS AND VEN DISEL THEY ARE SO CUTE .I LOVE RACING AND CARS. I DONT GET ENOUGH OF THIS MOVIE."								
"2003-12-13	1.0	12	19	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Summary:Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a former cop turned fugitive whose hobby happens to be racing cars.  Having left the L.A. area (the location of the first movie), he is finally caught in Miami.  But instead of sending him to jail, the authorities have a proposition for him - help them bring down local drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) and they'll forget about his criminal record.  Brian agrees, but only if he can choose his partner.  So he chooses an old friend from his childhood days in Barstow, CA, ex-convict Roman Pearce (Tyrese).The DEA has an agent inside Verone's operation, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), who hooks them up with a job to drive for Verone.  But for some reason Verone has decided he is ready to leave the country, so he has only one job for Roman and Brian, pick up a bunch of cash and drive it to an airport where he can get out of the country.  Roman and Brian, who are constantly fighting their police and DEA handlers, pull a few tricks in the process.  The result, they pull off the job, get Verone his money, capture him, save Fuentes (who has fallen in love with Brian), and get away with some of the loot - what a surprise!My Comments:Let's see, what does the movie have going for it... Story - terrible.  Acting - even worse.  Fast cars - nope.  What?  It doesn't even have fast cars?  Unless you consider 85 mph fast, nope.The story is just plain silly.  To begin with, Brian apparently has a massive rap sheet, but he was a cop?  Um, are cops allowed to do that?  I don't think so.  Second, okay, let's pretend that the DEA would be willing to let Brian expunge his record in order to help them.  And let's pretend even further that they would be willing to let a violent ex-convict be his partner.  And let's pretend even further further that they would completely disregard that Brian and Roman break a gazillion laws every time they get in a car and that Roman shooting at a DEA agent at one point in order not to blow their cover is 'cool'.  With all of this pretending, I just could not keep pretending when the movie has a highly successful drug lord use two cop-attracting racing cars to transport his money.  I mean, I'm no drug lord, but if it were me, I'd use old women in Cadillacs"	 cops never pull them over.  This has to be the silliest premise for a movie I have ever seen.  The sole purpose is to present a situation where cars can go fast.  Who cares that it would never happen, right?  Well, why make it into a movie with the trimmings of a story if the story is so implausibly ridiculous that it would be better if it didn't exist?  I don't get it.Another serious problem I had with the story and movie is the fact that every time you got more than one car racing lunatic together with another, it inevitably included about 100+ scantily clad women who were perfectly okay with the fact that they were just being used for their breasts and vaginas.  The car racing culture portrayed in this movie doesn't exist (if you believe it does, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you in Brooklyn...).  I'm supposed to believe that these women have nothing better to do with their time than sit around and watch people race cars, watercraft, etc. all day.  They don't work?  Please!As far as the acting goes, this are B-movie actors.  No one is good.  But since this movie isn't about the story or the acting, just about portraying a non-existent racing culture and fast cars, it shouldn't matter.  But wait, the cars aren't fast...So, what was up with the cars only doing 80 to100 mph?  I do 80 on my way to work in the morning.  Maybe I should take a camera with me and make a movie.  I drive a Honda Civic	 does that mean I've got a racing machine?  Heck, I've even driven 120 mph (not on the way to work, but that's another story...), which was about the fastest I think I saw the speedometers go.  So, why is this movie called 2 Fast?  Ideally it would be in reference to the length of the movie, as it would be in its best interest to get it over with quick, before anyone realizes that what they just saw was ridiculously stupid.Overall, I don't recommend this movie for anyone, except those people who actually believe their is a cool, car-racing underground culture where stuff like this actually happens.  Sure, people race cars, but do they gather around several thousand people and close down streets to do it?  Only if they are as stupid as the makers of this movie and want to go to jail.  Don't see this movie!

"2003-06-13	1.0	3	6	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	a better title for 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is 2 DUMB 2 STUPID!  a total yawner from start to finish.  the MIAMI VICE pilot episode is better than this garbage!"								
"2014-01-12	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Favorite movie and i got a clean copy. Thats all I ever want out of movies. Im very happy with my purchase."								
"2010-09-14	1.0	0	54	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I was disapointed to open it and find that it was not the special edition so I had to return it just to pay $3 more to buy from another site"								
"2005-09-13	4.0	3	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie was great, of the cars that were featured in it and it was really great how they raced and how they showed everthing in it. The scenes were good too because they had lots of special effects that seemed real."								
"2007-06-19	3.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie was up and down, to an effect. Having seen both movies, anyone who saw the first one knows that Vin Diesel was what shaped the movie... not Paul Walker. I can't say I have anything against Paul Walker's acting, and much less Tyrese, but I do think that it was the idea of changing both the concept and the crew for this one.I mean, don't get me wrong. This movie has some parts that the first movie lacked. For example... this movie has the humor that the first movie needed. Hell, the first one probably would have been a -LOT- better if it could have been as funny as this one was. This one had the saturation of humor that everyone probably wanted anyway. Not too little, not too much. The first one had none at all.On top of that, the plot, the concept, the acting, actors, and the backstory pretty much all change. No one has any idea that O'Conner (Walker) has any history with street racing. In addition we never knew he grew up in Florida or anything like it.As we can see from the first movie he drives like he's a newb when he's at the speedway in Los Angeles, and in the second movie you hear Tyrese discussing about them both being fast drivers in the past, and so on.I guess the concept lost it's depth when they chose to put Cole Hauser (Paparazzi) in. I dislike his acting ability on the whole. I thought he sucked in Paparazzi and he wasn't much better in this one.Not to mention the change of location, the whole location flip flopped. It went from pacific to Atlantic, and neither of these movies have anything to do with one another. If they -really- planned to do this movie with Paul Walker returning, they should have based it somewhere else out of California, like Malibu or something.If they wanted to keep it Miami-oriented, they should have went for a new lead actor and dropped Walker altogether.On the whole, the movie was fine but I dislike it for what it's lacking, originality more than anything. I wouldn't recommend buying it right away. Go rent it to see if you like it first. I wager some will like it, and some won't."								
"2014-06-23	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	It was good no Sraches when I got it over all I am very pleased very good movie  R.I.P. Paul walker you will be missed"								
"2003-07-06	4.0	8	8	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 fast 2 furious lives up to its title- somewhat. it isn't the fastest or the most furious, but it's airheaded and fluffy enough to move quickly without being attatched to the strings of an actual plot.But its lack of an intriguing storyline doesn't destroy its fun factor.  the souped up hot rods polished to a fine sheen speeding down the streets of miami make for some rather satisfying guilty pleasures.And if you'd rather feast your eyes on something more than oversized hot wheels in a rainbow of colors, you won't be disappointed.  the men have the pleasures of drooling a little puddle over shapely women, but we girls definately aren't left out in the cold.Studly Paul walker with his charmingly innocent grin, and his accomplis Tyrese with his toned body (and urge to constantly rip his shirt off) would make any girl faint (if they weren't sitting in a chair)if you want something quick, that doesn't require too much thought, is loaded with eye candy, light hearted, fun, and will help you munch your way through your stale, overly buttery popcorn, than this movie is what you've been searching for."								
"2002-12-15	1.0	2	36	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	i like the fast and the furious movie bikous its amizing you could even see nice cars so you could have any idea of cars you can even learn about cars."

"2005-08-07	4.0	2	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This was a cool and action packed film. I loved the car racing and intense fight scenes, as well as the hot babes and strong men. It also had some funny parts, and I liked the final fight with the big boat and car and gun thing. It had plenty of swears, and of course lots of cool and colorful cars. Guns, too. I liked this movie a lot  not just because of that, but also because it showed the importance  of teamwork and friendship. Anyone who likes racing, fighting, or both should see this movie. It's well worth the money you'll spend."

"2003-08-31	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I think this is a GREAT movie!! I guess If i had to pick 1 thing that I didnt like about it was the fact that they leave you hanging on what happend to Dom. (Vin Diesel) they mention it a cuple of times in the 2nd movie but he didnt say anything about it. but besides that I really recomend the movie to anyoe who likes fast and good looking cars!!!"								
"2003-10-01	3.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I would have to say the glamour and glory of this film was great, flashy cars, fast women, drugs, money, etc.  Besides Paul Walker, the rest of the cast was 2 lack of acting and screen friendly.  Should have knitted a sweater instead of watching the movie"								
"2013-12-02	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	may your soul rest in peace now paul and thanks for the great action films. dam!!! we'll miss you bro"

"2004-07-28	1.0	1	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	When I first saw the preview of 2 fast 2 furious in the tv commercial,I thougt that the movie will do a great job bringing the old cast back from The fast and the furious.But when I found out that Vin diesel was'nt going to appear in the second part,I was'nt happy about it at all.However,Paul walker who play the role of an ex-cop,tried his best to save the movie but he could'nt do it...It did'nt get the good stuff that part 1 got,the driving and the crashing looked too much like The Simpsons Road Rage,The Simpsons hit & run and Namco's Smashing drive.Spend your money in another place."								
"2014-02-23	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Hot guys, hot cars, lots of action throughout the whole movie you will never be unhappy with the series always wanting more at the end"								
"2014-01-03	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Ahh this is one of my favorite movies from the F&F series! I definitely recommend this movie if you're feelin' down or just need a laugh!"								
"2003-11-10	3.0	2	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Let's face it.  If you saw the first installment (99 out of 100 of you), you didn't watch the sequel with anything in mind but more hot chicks, more kick ass cars, and more spectacular race sequences.  From the moment the drawbridge went up in the first race sequence I knew this movie wasn't going to dissapoint (from those perspectives, of course).The plot is textbook.  The cops are stupid (INCREDIBLY stupid).  The 'lead' actors are laughable (Paul's 'cuz-talk' actually makes for some of the most hilarious 'I'm trying really hard to sound like I'm from the hood' dialog I've heard in awhile!).BUT...There is eye candy everywhere.  The cars kick ass.  The special effects kick ass.  The races kick ass.  Anything to do with driving in this movie kicks ass.Then, who really went to see this expecting anything but?  The movie delivers exactly where it's supposed to.  Defenitely worth the rent.Let's see the '455 Rocket' as the star of #3!!!"								
"2013-05-28	4.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This wasn't bad. It's true to the type of movie it's meant to be: fast cars, hot women, Paul Walker. It was decent enough and kept true to the storyline of #1, at least in my opinion.Shipping was great, packaging is great, everything that way was great."								
"2004-03-07	2.0	1	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Paul Walker returns in this sequel to 2001's The Fast and the Furious. Brian O'Conner (Walker) has left L.A due to his illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami making money here and there by street racing.  Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes (Mendes), Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by Agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Hauser)in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barsto, Arizona where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese) to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With the help of Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone.  This was a horrible movie.  There was no reason to make a sequel.  They should have stopped after the first one."								
"2003-06-27	5.0	4	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious is a awesome movie that you should defiantly see!This is even better than the original Fast and the Furious in many ways. 2 Fast 2 Furious has a better storyline and better special affects.Even though Vin Desiel isn't in this one,who really needs him anyway?Tyrease is cool in this one.The acting is very good here too.This is a must see in my opinion.I'm sure you will probably enjoy it."								
"2003-11-11	1.0	1	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Talk about a crummmy job.  It's hard to decide which is worse - the acting, dialogue, photography, sound, &quot"	plot&quot	, or racing. If you are a racing addict and want some perky babes at the same time this may fill the bill for a few minutes.  But that's all there is.The plot must be the product of a &quot	Movies for Dummies&quot	 book, some mixed-up story about crime and racing and deadlines and gals and friends.  The only thing more predictable than the plot is the acting which is straight out of Central Casting.  Even my son who loves this type of movie admitted it was a &quot	dog&quot	 which, in any generation, means bad.  Avoid at all costs.		
"2012-03-03	4.0	2	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	The movie was in good condition. My problem was that I needed the item by a certain day and nowhere did it say this was an OUT OF THE COUNTRY SELLER! I think that needs to be posted somewhere so that you know before you buy your product. I contacted them and they had slow contact time so of course it was already sent out and too late."								
"2013-06-08	3.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I feel bad saying this, but this is one of those movies where I derive entertainment from watching the movie fail. The plot works, but it is really stupid and full of wholes. The only character moments are between the two supposedly heterosexual leads and how they each hate it when the other hits on females, and that is always hilarious to watch. The CGI is AWFUL and makes the action scenes that don't feature real cars feel absolutely surreal. The rest of the characters are one dimensional stereotypes full of hip-hop bravado and sexist stupidity. This movie is not good, but it is entertaining. Worth a rental, not worth a buy."								
"2003-12-29	1.0	8	13	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	The only reason I signed up for Amazon.com was to write a truthfull review.  I would really give this movie a negative star rating or even a zero, but I cannot.  Let me start off by saying that back in 2001, I saw The Fast and the Furious and thought it was the coolest movie in the world.  I have since then matured and realized what a crappy movie it was and how much they don't have a clue about what they're talking about.  Like how you can pop the hood and see a NOS fogger system AND, direct port nitrous injection AND, a stand alone fuel management system(and that's only in one scene).  But away from the past, this movie is ten times worse.  For starters, they turned it into a movie geared at only one audience, black people and people that like to copy them.  With slang, rap music, hydralics and numerous other items from the &quot"	Hip Hop&quot	 community, this movie tries to blend show and go, but that is not really possible.  Anyone that knows anything about cars knows that air bags, neon lights, big spoilers, chrome rims or just plain any rims over 17 inches, TV's, $10,000 stereos, and playstation 2's will not help you out in the speed factor of your automobile.  It just saddens my heart to see what started off as a great phenomonon with the first movie, into neon lights and hip hop music.  This is absolutly the dumbest movie about cars I have ever seen.  The kids that like this movie think that cars that look cool and run 17 second quarter mile times are fast.  They like to go crusing, and race other cars like their's and think when they win against a civic with exhaust their car is the fastest on the block.  I also read a big feature article in Super Street, where they got to test the cars from the movie, and the cars times were SLOWER than stock.  All the did for the movie was weigh them down with chrome rims and computer s***.  I also found out they disengaged the all-wheel drive on the skyline, just so it could drift around corners to look cool.  This movie really gives true car enthusiasts a bad BAD name.  THIS MOVIE SUCKS.  F*** YOU 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS.

Tyrese Gibson can act...Who knew ? Great action, and all the car chases you can handle...probably more. Eva Mendes is nice to look at...as always, and Cole Hauser is cool as hell...as always. If hot cars, hot girls, great action and a better than expected story are your thing....Give this a look. A generally good film. 3 Stars."

"2003-07-02	5.0	3	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Let me start out by saying how much fun this movie was!! The action was awesome the acting was average and the directing was good. Some people complain that the some of the car chases amd races are digital effects, that my be, but it makes the car chases really cool, because they do things that you can't do in real life. This is pure brainless fun! My dad even enjoyed it! Leave your brain at home and have a great time! Trust me!"

"2014-07-02	1.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	The movie is a little bit blurry and volume is a little bit rough"

"2004-11-15	2.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Paul Walker can act as well as a brick wall. He is that bad.But beyond that the movie is semi-watchable.The Skyline race at the beginning was the highlight of the film and the rest just went downhill. The cars rocked in the first one from old school muscle to tricked Civics and Supras. What do we get in the sequel? Two Mitsubishi stinkers.Did Mitsubishi pay off the director or something to have their dying car lines in the movie?All in all it was an ok popcorn movie but it is a total waste when compared to Diesel and the first movie."								
"2013-12-07	2.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I had only seen the first Fast movie, so I thought I would watch the others.  After watching this one, I was disappointed.  As nice as it was to See Paul Walker, the plot was horrible.  I plan on watching the others (except Tokyo Drift) & I hope they are not as bad as this one.  Tyrese was okay & I hope his acting improves in the other movies."								
"2005-02-07	4.0	4	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I personally liked this movie as well as the first.  Granted it relied heavily on Paul Walker but I think he did a great job and Tyrese brought the humor.  It worked well for them...you can tell they had a friendship chemistry because it flowed for them.  I loved this movie and thought the action was there...the cars were neat and I liked the music.In this movie Paul is no longer a cop and is involved in drag racing in order for them not to arrest him they make him a deal to help uncover a drug ring and he tells them he wants to have his own buddy work on the case with him (Tyrese) only problem is Tyrese is on house arrest and lives in a trailer so he can move his house. (Funny!)  They don't really like one another because of some past business, but well work well together!  Together will try and bust the drug ring and to find out if they do watch the movie!  It is worth it!  The racing in this movie is also great along with the cars.  They are tircked out to the max!  If you compare this movie to the first one it is not exactly up to the same speed.

"2003-10-03	5.0	3	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This is better then the original.  First off Miami is a much better location for this kinda movie than LA was in the first.People said the movie would suck cause there was no diesel, they're wrong, Tyrese is better than diesel, and unlike vin diesels character, Tyrese's actually has a sense of humor.  Cars are better too.  The Nissan Skyline itself was sweeter than any car in the first.  The ending was also better, jumping a charger onto a yacht.  This movie doesnt make you think, its a great popcorn flick."

I especially liked the semi truck scene.Also, it was nice seeing a couple of American made hot cars in this film.I boughtFast & Furious: 1-5 Bundle [Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet] so it's on to #3 Tokyo Drift next. I love these movies."								
"2014-04-11	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This series is one of my favorites.  Admittedly a guilty pleasure as I'm an American muscle driver though and through, but that doesn't eradicate the joy I get from watching these movies.2 Fast 2 Furious is tied for my second favorite at this point too.  Only Fast Five beats it in my book.  The sequel immediately moved away from street drag racing to more of a rally-style race.  From my own (on track) experience this type of driving is a lot more fun.  Having something of a connection probably help me enjoy it more.The key to any Fast and Furious movie is to go into it expecting nothing more than a thrill-ride experience.  That's exactly what you get in this movie.  If you enjoy fun, car centric movies I can highly recommend 2 Fast 2 Furious (and the rest of the series for that matter)."

"2005-01-16	2.0	3	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	John Singleton, best known for urban dramas like ""Boyz N The Hood"" and ""Poetic Justice"", takes some time off to pay the bills with a commerical property, a sequel to ""The Fast And The Furious"", 2001's big dumb adrenaline-filled car chase movie starring Vin Diesel. Vin's out of the picture in this one and vanilla-white Paul Walker is stuck carrying the bag with a supporting cast that includes R&B"	 singer Tyrese (who made his film debut in Singleton's last movie, "Baby Boy") and the beautiful Eva Mendez. Also involved is rapper Ludacris who helps Singleton keep up his "rapper-per-movie quota".Walker's renegade cop Brian O'Connor is back and this time, he's paired with his estranged childhood friend (played by Tyrese) so that they can infiltrate a Miami kingpin's organization. (Don't ask me. I didn't write it.) Walker, who if not for Keanu Reeves, would probably be the least charismatic leading man in cinema history, is still able to blend in as a criminal henchman despite the fact that he looks about as menacing as the cast of "Leave It To Beaver". Tyrese, who seems to forgive and forget his estranged buddy sending him to prison in record time does a decent job overall but it doesn't do much to save this one from being a mess."2 Fast 2 Furious" is a dissapointing sequel to a movie that was for the most part, an overrated full-length car commercial disgusied as a movie. While the original at least had its share of entertaining moments despite its juvenile plot and cardboard characters, this sequel doesn't seem to have such luck. Singleton, who still remains one of my favorite directors despite his involvement in this atrosity, should have known better than to take on this one.

"2003-08-31	4.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious, the new action flick starring Paul Walker, Tyrese and Eva Mendes is just reasonable and surprisingly good.  Though I had my doubts for this film, it proved to be better than I anticipated.  Paul Walker improves his acting abilities, and the films somehow works without the presence of Vin Diesel, (who gave a good, solid performance in 2001's The Fast and the Furious).  Though the film has a retread plot, it some how entertains.  The main reason to see this film is the real nice cars and locations in Miami.  Paul Walker returns as cop Brian Earl Spilner and works with his old pal recently released from prison, Roman played by model, singer and actor Tyrese.  Walker and Tyrese must track down a deadly leader, played by Cole Hauser.  Director John Singleton sustains full throttle entertainment with stunning, well choreographed race sequences looking better than those demonstrated in the original.  Also starring rapper Ludrakis and Chanel model Devon Aoki.  Gorgeous Eva Mendes also costars.2 Fast 2 Furious is rated PG-13 for Street Racing, Violence, Some Sensuality and Language.  The violence primarily consists of fisticuffs and less gunplay.  Language and sexuality are also fairly substantial. After viewing it in theatres on opening day, I was rather pleased.  I must say it is worth seeing in theatres and possibly owning on Video and or DVD, see it!"

"2005-05-04	2.0	2	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Even worse than the first, 2f2f showing us that it is not Paul Walker that is making these movies watchable.Tyrese is no better, with more brawn than brains, who teams up with Walker to get back on the good side of the law and bring down a drug lord.So far we have our basic plot, and Rob Cohan does nothing to change the formula except in changing cars and girls. So much for Paul Walker's proclamations of love for Vin's sister.So our to intrepid heroe's are given really hot cars and are sent out on their mission with a pat on the back, and a warning in their ear on not to try anything funny. Tyrese, our hothead, is a macho man who tries to step over the boundries everytime, and often gets into really stupid situations because of his defience. Situations that really don't cause them physical harm which makes them even more macho and sure of them selves in the long run.The cars here aren't as cool, being bulky and loud, plus, the two cars given to Tyrese and Walker give the need to laugh heartily over the green and purple paint jobs on their cars, and wonder what candy shop the pair happened to swipe them at. The driving also leaves some to be desired, what happened to the cool stunts in the first one, where they defied death by swinging in and out under trucks, and racing past speeding trains?Not here, thats for sure, the only suicidiel stunt is in the end where Walker pilots the car off a ramp and onto the fleeing speed boat.How convenient.Overall, this movie did not impress me, but i'm certan that guys will find this to their liking as the girls are plenty, and the cars even more so."								
"2003-06-15	2.0	9	37	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This follow up to the awful 2001 movie ""The Fast and the Furious"", although better (with the ax of wooden actor, Vin Diesel) is still is too flawed.  We begin with a street race and we watch as it rediculously turns into a drug bust.  The movie wasn't exciting in the least.  The often failed attempts at humor was quite sickening.  And I hate how they make cops out to be like monsters.  If you really like these kinds of movies I wuld reccomend seeing it when it plays an FX or such because this movie was a waste of seven dollars.  This movie was just a collection of criminal-glorifying chase-scenes with a higher budget than usual.  Go see The Italian Job instead and while your at it thank the cops for what a wondeful heroic job they are doing, risking their lives for our well being.  What I don't get is how these criminals get involved with a drug-bust.  Only reccomended to die-hard ""Fast and the Furious"" fans.  A nice popcorn muncher otherwise if you must see a movie and you've seen Bruce Almighty, Finding Nemo, or The Italian Job."								
"2009-04-16	5.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I can't understand how people can say this sequal is not as good or not better than the first.Do you miss Vin? He's kinda irrelevant to this story. The action is there. great driving and stunts. Paul Walker is just a fun guy to watch. I recommend it. I own it and watch it all the time."								
"2003-10-01	5.0	4	9	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	this movie is definitely a must! the first was definitely one was the best films ever!, and with all the many hot actors/actress' this films kick @$$. I love it! I like this movie so good that I actually bought the same car as Brian has in the movie...the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 2003. There are so many cool cars and the plot is good. There is one part where Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Roman Pierce (Tyrese) are trying to escape from the police and they go into a garage...before you know it thousands of cars flee from the 20 door garage! It is definitely one of the most thought out movies. You might thinks its a guy flick considering the hot girls and cars, but my friends dig Paul Walker and Tyrese. Did i mension that Ludacris and Eva Mendes are in it to. Well ludacris doesn't race, although, he is definitely TIGHT! The first movie was great, although, it gets boring once you watch it about 20 times, believe me. This movie definitely doesn't. The many cars, the setting, and the coloring are amazing. I see a lot of movies! I'm talking a lot. I see probably 9 out of 10 movies playing in theatres every time one comes out. I am telling you whoever is a Fast and the Furious fan will love this, and if u havent seen the first see it and then watch this one! its awesome! When this came into theatres on June 6th, 2003 and its now October 1st, 2003, I went right from school with two of my friends and saw it. I get out at 2:10 and i saw a 2:45 show. Believe it or not the theatre was still packed at 2:45 with school kids and everything. Iv'e only been to a couple of movies besides star wars and the lord of the rings where people clapped, they certainly clapped straight through this one, and to you ladies Tyrese rips his shirt off, just for a little change of heart which i can't believe somebody would have anything to say bad against this film anyway. Director: John Singleton has true talent. This movie is a must. 5 STARS! 10 OUT OF 10! TWO THUMBS UP! FIRES ON ALL CYLINDERS!! BUY IT TODAY!! 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS 2 DAY!!!"

"2009-09-23	3.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Lordy Lord! Another crap sequel from the Hollywood stable of rubbish rehashes. I had low expectations of this movie....it doesn't have Vin Diesel in it for a start. But what I got was a collection of wooden actors and cheesy lines, interspersed with ""race"" sequences that made me laugh a lot. I should have realised it was going to be dire literally from the get-go. The Universal logo mutates into a chrome-plated wheel in the most irritatingly ludicrous manner. So what is so horrible about this film? For a start the acting sucks worse than a Dyson. The opening race meet scene had me cringing in my seat, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Then there's the plot, or lack of one. Let's rehash the first film and nobody'll notice. Bah!  The scripting is awful. The hero's buddy (name escapes me due to disinterest) actually steals something from a supposed drug-baron (again not sure if he was a drug-baron, was fighting the urge to read the paper at the time) whilst the latter is offering him a job. Come on! That makes about as much sense as ....well....nothing! You just would not do that, unless you were the world's most retarded individual. Sadly, his character survives the movie. Then there's the villain's two goons, who come across as stereotypical thick grunts who haven't had an original thought between them for years. Tiresomely predictable.  The cars all look like they've escaped from a Scalextric set, with the exception of the hero's racer, which has had the ""mobile tanning salon"" upgrade. Damn, but he's gonna get skin cancer and cattaracts if he continues to drive that! Then you have to wonder just what sort of engine can accelerate a car from 0-80 in gasp!, only 20 seconds! Such speed! G-Forces pulling.....can't continue.....review.....must hit....brake! Yep, I could take my old Vauxhall Vectra out and give these machines a run for their money! Twenty seconds....sheeeshh!  The crowning hilarity regarding the race scenes was that a) the cars apparently needed nitrous to reach 100mph, and b) When they hit the nitro the cars went into hyperspace. I'm serious! Everything blurred and streaked past. Everytime it happened I kept expecting to see Chewbacca pop up from the back, waving a wrench and going ""Whoooaarrhg!"" Give me a break! I have to say this had me in stitches every time it happened but I'm surprised they didn't resort to burning tire-tracks a la Back to the Future as well. So lame.  Another annoying fact is that Hollywood seems to think that 80mph is fast and 100mph only reachable by real racer types. Obviously they've never been on any British motorway. And our hero clocked 150mph in his death-defying leap off a bridge. It would all perhaps seem more impressive than it was, if the streets were narrower, or you actually cared about any of the characters. Or that a motorcyclist wasn't clocked on the M1 doing 157 mph. And he didn't even have R2D2 on the back, much less Chewie.  So, underwhelmed would be the best word to sum up this film. The racing isn't exciting, the acting is bad and the plot is some Miami Vice reworking with incredulous bits thrown in for bad measure. All in all, a better name for this film might have been ""The Dull and the Repetitive"""								
"2008-04-01	4.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Out of all the sequels that came out in the summer of 2003 I have to say the one I was the most excited about was 2 Fast 2 Furious. I remeber W]walking out of an advance screening and among the crowd I saw the film many of us were saying better than the first, they didn't need Vin etc etc. John Singleton who for the record is a much better director than Rob Cohen has crafted a film that non race fans, fans of the first and those in in the mood for a good time can all enjoy. The film starts with an nice litte race between four characters in the movie and we then have our plot set up. Brian (Paul Walker) is promised a clean record if he helps the Feds bring down Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). Brian agress only if his old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibosn) can help him. What then follows is full of eye candy in the form of cars , beautiful women and action sequences. A lot of people don't want to see this moive because it lacks the Diesel but who cares he's gone there isn't one mention of Domonic Toretto or anyone from the first film for that matter. This is Brian's story but once again his costar and sidekick Tyrese steals this movie from him. Ludacris also does a great job in his first big movie and has more than five mintues of screen time unlike Ja Rule in the first film. All in all a fun film that truly is what summer movie are about having fun. Leave your ambitions and doubts at the door and just go in and have fun with this one ."								
"2003-08-14	1.0	3	6	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	You know, I have no idea who on earth gave this lame turkey of a movie the green light to being made.Sure, I'll go for some brainless adrenaline-drenched fun from time to time but unfortunately, even when I'm in a ""I just want to have fun"" mood, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" fails in just about everyway it could. In fact, it FAILS COMPLETELY!Lots of the negative elements that dogged down the first one were mostly balanced out by excellent visual effects and enjoyable, if not realistic actions scenes and resulted in a movie that was fun but stupid all at the same time. Sadly, I cannot say the same thing aobut the sequel. This movie is just DUMB, without being fun.Whatever went wrong with this, really went wrong. What really disgusts me in this movie, as well as the first one is that it totally reduces the woman down to just mere 'objects'! The girls in this one are FAR, FAR worse than those from the first one. I don't mean to sound like I'm a shallow, superficial punk but THEY ARE TOTALLY HIDEOUS AND SICKENING TO LOOK AT!! Blech! I in no way am implying that sexuality is evil. Quite the contrary, sexuality is beautiful but it makes me sick to see how they portray girls as mere 'objects' in movies like this. At least 95 percent of casual girls I see in my neighborhood, look FAR more attractive than alot of the characters in this movie. I might be taking heat for bashing them but I totally stand by my verdict. When it comes to a good female character in a movie, I'd rather take class and intelligence anyday over mere bare skin! None of the female characters looked attractive at all. That one character (I forget her name) looks more like an alien from outer space! She's HIDEOUS!!! I don't mean to sound like a superficial person but holy mother of God, they are just repulsive to a maximum degree!The souped-up cars may be cool to watch but this is just a rehashed version of the first F&F"	 movie, without the fun of that one. In fact, "2 Fast" felt more like a bad 2 hour long NASCAR commercial with excessive amounts of MGM Grand colors thrown in.Maybe I'm just growing up, maybe I'm getting too old for this dragracing stuff but "2 Fast 2 FUrious" is just a complete pile of cinematic manure. This garbage is primarily aimed at lowlifes who know nothing more than to throw tantrums because his/her parents can't afford to buy him/her a brand spanking new car!But hey, I might have bashed this movie to pieces with this review but even then, I'm against censorship so don't let me stop you from seeing this. I just wanted to let you know that there are MUCH better movies out there that deliver lots more than this turkey. Go see "Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines" instead as it has FAR superior action. Or dive into the first and third "Indiana Jones" movies instead. Believe me, the cars may have been really old-fashioned but the car chase scenes in these two movies are FAR more intelligent and truckloads more fun than these sportcar races. If you want to see a bunch of sportcar races, go watch a NASCAR race or better yet, attend a NASCAR racing event like the Indianapolis 500. At least the adrenaline is right in front of you.Hollywood owes us an apology for this mess.

"2008-02-02	3.0	2	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious is your typical sequal.  The actions scenes and effects nearly double that of the original.  We have a returning character - Brian O Conner (Paul Walker), with the rest of the cast composed of fresh faces that don't carry the same charm from the firt film.  Then there is the story, script and dialouge - all felt thrown together with the excuse to produce a sequal so we can get another chance at more tricked out rides and races.  Unfortunately unlike its predacessor, all that leaves an impression in the end is the race action.The film begins right away with an explosive street race in Miami at night, which I found more enjoyable than the street race in the first F&F"	 film.  In fact, this is one of the best action senes of the movie.  At the finish line, cops arrive soon after and take in Brian, who is already wanted for helping Torretto escape in the first film.  Brian's record can be wiped clean if he plays ball by going undercover and busting a big dealer in the area - Verone.  Brian requests that his old pal "Roman Pierce" (Tyrese) accompany him to complete the deal.  The pair go undercover, working for Verone, where another undercover (Eva Mendes) joins them.  The whole Miami-drug dealer plotline felt too cliche, so it added very little interest for me.  Verone was very boring as the villain and his men are laughably bad and uninteresting.  The script and dialouge only adds to the problem, making the film as a whole seem very juvenille and thrown together as compared to the first film.The races and cars are obviously the reason to watch this.  The first street race is probably the best, but there are numerous other races and cop chases on the highways throughout the film too.  The driving felt faster and more intense this time around.  Unlike the first film, we do not nearly get to see into these vehicles as much and what makes them tick (except the gps units the cops installed to watch both Brian and Rome).  The two cars that they are given to drive in are nice, but like the owners of the two muscle cars in the film say, kinda look like "cracker jack toys".  They just didn't have as strong appeal as the rides in the first film either.  The bonus this time around was the muscle cars.  There are several race and chase scenes involving these beautiful machines.  So if you are into American muscle, there is definelty more of that this time around.This is an ok sequal, pretty average as far as sequals go.  If you loved the first for the cars and races, you should be satisfied with 2F2F.  However, the rest of the movie doesn't carry much else to even the load.This dvd (just like the Fast and the Furious Tricked Out Edition) contains a 6 minute short film of Brian's journey from L.A. to Miami, which sets up the beginning of this film.Acting - 3Action - 4Characters - 3Story - 3Overall - 3.5							
"2007-01-18	4.0	0	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	When I first seen 2 Fast 2 Furious, it wasn't all that to me.  I first watched this movie with my old tv so that can be called ""480i"" television.By the time I got an new HDTV from Wal-Mart, it an Sanyo model: DP26746 Integrated HDTV.. I had my Playstation 3 hook up to that HDTV with HDMI cable and play that movie in the slot and the quality looks so good, I had to adjust my brightness a little dark. Well  thats all I can say about this movie, it has the best picture and the story is just average but fun.  So, if u get the same device i have.. you will see what I am talking about.  My HDTV display resolution at 1366 x 768 WXGA screen, so you know it is above 720p and less than 1080i/1080p but great picture on screen."

"2003-10-23	5.0	3	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Too Fast Too Furious was ann awesome movie.But it's only awesome to those who like Street Racing Automobiles.I personally thought it was better than the first movie because it showed more detailed cars.Overall, I hope they make a thirds one that would include Tyrese and Vin Deisal along with the blonde guy. I think that movie would explode at the Box Office."								
"2011-09-29	4.0	4	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	While this movie is not super plausible and definitely not an Oscar winner, it is very entertaining between fast cars and racing and watching the actors strut their stuff.  It is not one that you watch to enrich your life, you watch it because it's just a lot of fun and a great escape!"								
"2005-06-11	5.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I love this movie. It will have you out of your seat every minute. I like japanese cars and street racing, so this movie is perfect for me. And this movie has my 3 favorite cars, the Nissan Skyline, Toyota Supra, and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. There are also Honda S2000, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Mazda RX-7, and a lot of other good cars. This movie has better acting than the first one. Tyrese actually makes the movie a little funny."

Only the last jump was really unrealistic, but hey it's a movie for something (cause u can't do stuff like that in real life). Fast n furious 1 was a 5 for me, but i think they could have chosen a better car than the Lancer Evo, not that it's ugly but there r whay much nicer cars. Anyway, still a good movie."								
"2003-07-17	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is better than the original ""The Fast And The Furious"". It has more action and the cars and races are better.  In the first one, Vin Diesel's in it. But he is absent in this one. The plot of the movie goes like this. Former LAPD Cop Brian O' Connor (Paul Walker) is sent on a mission. He must go to Miami to find and capture a drug dealer, Carter Verone. But O' Connor needs help from an old friend, Roman Pierce (Tyrese). Another cop, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), must go undercover as Verone's girlfriend. O' Connor's friend, Tej (Ludacris), helps with the mission in some ways. With the great special effects, action, and cars, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is the hottest movie of the summer."								
"2003-06-06	1.0	0	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I don't believe it. First, they made ""Fast and the Furious"", probably the dumbest movie of 2001. Now, they made a sequel, a ""trikkd-out noo DVD"", T-Shirts, the whole shebang. This movie franchise pushes more you-know-what than an incontinent elephant. OK, this one doesn't have Vin Diesel (who gets my award for Worst Actor Ever), but it still has all the social significance of the Anna Nicole Smith show. I mean, really, was that car getting run over by the tractor trailer supposed to look even REMOTELY real? It looked like it was made of plastic. Also, let me guess: no plot? Didn't think so. This summer, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this claptrap. See Terminator 3: The Rise Of The Machines instead.And you KNOW I am through."								
"2013-07-09	3.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	It was better than some of the other of that genre, however, my complaint is that you don't offer captioning which I need at times.  I hope you make this adjustment soon."								
"2003-10-12	3.0	1	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Fueled by low expectations, 2 Fast 2 Furious (what an awful title) far surpassed its predecessor, exceeding as the movie I expected the original to be. 2F2F has much more action, more outrageous stunts, a plot that I find better suited to this material, and an even sexier cast of scantily-dressed women. For a little over an hour-and-a-half, I was in big-budget, B-movie heaven.Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is no longer with the LAPD, stripped of his badge after the events of the first film. Now in Miami, he makes his earnings through illegal street racing, something that proves to be an easy task for him. But after one particular (and superbly exhilarating) race where he comes out the big winner, he's caught by federal agents and forced to work undercover to nab a powerful drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser).They've already got an agent undercover, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), but have yet to pin Verone on anything serious. To infiltrate Verone's empire, O'Connor teams up with old friend and ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)"	 together, they make for a wild and dangerous driving duo, performing transportation tasks for Verone, including one final assignment that could prove particularly dangerous for O'Connor and Pearce.2F2F, as with most big-budget blockbuster sequels, ups the ante on its predecessor	 it's bigger, louder, much faster, and in this case, a whole lot more fun. The race/chase sequences are far more elaborate (unlike the original, when these guys race they actually turn curves and drive pretty long distances, rather than a mere mile-long straight line as in the original) and they're in greater abundance here, a smart move since we're clearly here to watch hardcore automotive stunts, not plot.The story is every bit as dumb as you'd expect from such a lame title, but at least it gives the characters goals and genuine obstacles to overcome (unlike the original, which basically had its &quot	heroes&quot	 trying to steal dvd players from trucks in broad daylight). The twists and turns are all easily forseeable (what are the chances Verone won't find out these guys are working undercover?), but the story rarely gets in the way of the action.2F2F boasts three major action setpieces, each of them successively more impressive than the setpiece it follows. The opening race is a doozy and by itself, more exciting than the whole of the first movie. Another race early in the movie puts our heroes (and multiple &quot	tryouts&quot	) in a test to retrive a package in an auto pound 20 miles away, with Walker even driving backwards on the highway at one point. It's the climax that clinched the movie for me, a twenty-minute sequence with cop cars and choppers chasing O'Connor and Pearce, the whole thing concluding with an outrageous but exhilarating stunt between a car and a boat.Even as a B-movie, 2F2F isn't perfect. At a restrictive PG-13, the opportunity for profanity, edgy violence, and nudity is gone. The latter, in particular, is rather irksome. The leading ladies, Eva Mendes and Devon Aoki, are almost as good a reason as all the car stunts to watch the movie. Aoki probably boasts the best-looking body I've seen all year long (a lot of people have criticized her face, but I find it quite uniquely pretty), nice eye candy enhanced by some tight outfights. More screen time for her would have been appreciated.The movie probably could have benefited from the presence of Vin Diesel, but I also have a hard time seeing him fitting into the proceedings. Besides, Walker and Tyrese make an acceptable pairing, the latter of whom delivers an enthusiastically energetic performance. Walker has the straight man role, which is just fine for his rather limited acting skills (though some bad acting on his part is apparent from scene to scene). Cole Hauser makes for a solid villain, and Eva Mendes is strictly eye candy as Walker's love interest (whether or not she's got any talent remains to be seen).2F2F delivers what's expected of it, it may be one of the summer's dumber offerings, but it's undeniably also one of the more thrilling ones, too. If another sequel is ever made (and judging from the box office results, I'd say that's a safe bet), let's hope profanity, edgy violence, and nudity will be thrown into the mix.

"2005-08-27	5.0	3	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I found this movie to be worth a lot of fun before it was a lot of fun, and that is because everyone in the movie got along so well. The leadership behind the movie shows through in a-typical ways lending a deafening mode to the good beating out the bad guys. You can't say that it is loud justice, because you would never hear it"	 but in never betraying sophistication, it makes a towering intellectual victory. All of the scenes and stunts are absolutely devouring and the attention paid to the plot by the actors is at the very least a true marvel. And everything else is what happens when everything I just said, happens!

Isn't this garbage out of style yet."

"2005-07-24	1.0	2	6	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I don't really even need to write anything about this movie because the word ""Horrible"" describes it. I mean, you haven't seen bad movies until you've seen this. None of the lame jokes are funny, you know what's going to happen before watching it, the chases are stupid because you already know who's going to win and the movie is SO HORRID THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW YOU AWESOME CARS. Think about it, after you see the cars, you'll be like, oh, those cars are awesome and therefore you forget about the movie. The plot is so awfu and predictable and the acting is awful. It's cheesy and is probably one of the worse movies ever. Enough said. I wouldn't even get payed to own this or see it again and if I ever see a copy again, I'll probably set it on fire."								
"2012-05-04	2.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Ok,I'll be honest when I started this movie from the opening credits, I knew that this would not live to rival the fist. My fist point, with this realization is the underground racing wardrobe, was F A K E FAKE. From the weird jewelry to stereotyped shirts and pants. Secondly, the written dialog was awful and tried too hard to cool. It was not believable in the least bit. Thirdly the fact that it also drags in the middle and makes me want to skipped forward twenty minuets or so. When I got this I was expecting the racing action that I loved in the fist one. Instead of the great peal off nitrous shots the the ""warp-drive"" with the nitrous shots was a little hard to watch without getting a headache. Although  some great racing scenes  it should have included more, the only race scenes worth watching are the opening scene, the derby scene, and the ending chase scene. Oh I forgot those are the only race scenes. It would have been ok as a Miami Vice script, but not a Fast and Furious. Whatever the first one gave this series the second one wasted it. Universal, what were you thinking."

"2008-11-19	4.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	The level of absurdity and ridiculousness in John Singleton's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is irrelevant. If I were to launch a scathing attack citing its thin story, one-dimensional characters and lack of dialogue as the reason for my distaste towards it, I would be the dumb one. This is a film that delivers exactly what it promises and I have to admire it for that reason.Paul Walker is back as Brian O'Connor, the former Los Angeles undercover cop who let Vin Diesel go free at the end of the first installment. (Diesel, who shot to fame after the release of the original film chose not to return to the franchise.) Now in Miami, a dishonored Brian becomes once again embroiled in the world of illegal street racing that is as usual populated with car loads of hot babes, bad guys, and masses of extras on the sidelines. Despite his poor record, O'Conner is confronted by the police who promise to clear his name if he goes undercover as the driver for an evil drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) whose main function in the story is to convincingly set up a series of outlandish set pieces and provide the good characters with offers they can't refuse.While Diesel's character is missed, the screenwriters have supplied Walker with another fiery foil in Roman Pearce, played with great vigor by Tyrese Gibson. Also along for the ride is Monica Fuentes, a sexy customs agent played by Eva Mendes who has been posing as Verone's girlfriend for the past nine months.But who cares about characters in a movie like this? The action that is the main focus here and Singleton, who is best known for his 1991 drama ""Boys N the Hood"", is surprisingly well suited for the genre. His need and love of speed is clear throughout the movie and each action sequence seems to build off the previous one. Instead of focusing on character development and the grit and harshness of the surrounding Miami landscape, he is more concerned with the thrill of the chase, the roars of the engines, and the flashes of painted chrome. The end result is both fast and furious."								
"2013-05-30	5.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Not Shakespear people, doesn't even really have a strong plot, but there are fast cars and great stunts, so worth watching especially since the series seems to never end, you may want to keep up"

"2003-09-24	4.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This is one movie that lived up to the original and then some.  I was one that thought with the omission of Vin Diesel that this movie would be bad.  Although after watching it, I was forced to say Vin Diesel who?  Tyrese did a great job as the second man in the movie and Paul Walker did a good job of taking over the leading role.  It starts off a little far fetched with the cars in the beginning of the movie, but it gets better from there on in.  The only thing it did not have was a romantic interest.  Paul Walker comes close in a couple of scenes but nothing ever happens.  But this movie is not supposed to be a love story.  It definitely lives up to its title--2 fast 2 furious...go see it or buy it."								
"2013-06-23	1.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I purchased a DVD here and it was for a different system and did not play on my DVD in the USA.

"2013-07-29	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I think the Fast and Furious movies are a heck of a lot of fun. This is my least favorite of the series - but it's still a 5 star movie IMO. If you liked the first one, I'd suggest checking it out."								
"2004-10-09	5.0	3	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Its hard to say if this one is better than the original as there are differences between the two. First off the first had people you could really care about because it had the tension and acceptance for Brian and the drama of the gang finding out he was a cop. This one on the other hand is so fast paced that you can't tell what people are really thinking and what their reaction is going to be (Well it is Miami you know). This movie shows more about the cars and really, how tricked out they could be, expecially with great neons lights added to them (nice computer graphics there with the racing sequences as well). Pretty much the plot is Brian is on the run from helping a fugitive back in Fast and the Furious. He gets muscled by the FBI to either take down a drug lord by being one of his drivers. He tells the FBI that he wants to bring another driver with him and to have his record cleaned as well (which would of looked good with Vin being there). Lots of speed, sarcasm diaglog and great cars with the girls that go with them, this movie is meant to be a high impact fast paced movie. The only problem that I had was that Mia (Brians love interest from the first movie) was nowhere in this movie which almost made no sense since you had the impression that they were still good together when the first movie ended. If you like fast paced action or cars in general, a great movie to check out. If you don't like them... well see it anyways."

It's really cool.You'll love 'growling and roaring' engine sound, too. You can hear that almost every scene on newly upgraded version.I wanna recommend this movie for those who has a hobby and been interested in cool rides. :-)I hope it has DTS sound core on released dvd. I don't know why it doesn't have DTS track on that as previous version of 'Fast and Furious.'.If it is released with DTS sound track, I'll must buy it. :-)"								
"2004-02-06	5.0	2	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	It's not so bad as some peoples say.I like the customized cars this is why I rate it 5 stars.We can see a Nissan Skyline GT-R 00', Honda S2000 V-Tec, Toyota Supra RZ, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo.

"2003-10-06	3.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	There's no Vin Diesel this time around and I thought a sequel would  suck without him but...it doesn't. Tyrese (Babyboy) is a fun replacement and it's obvious that he's having a lot of fun in the movie as well. Some people have said Paul Walker can't act and that he doesn't have much of a presence without Vin Diesel. I can't say I had a problem with him though and think he does ok without Diesel. He's not the strongest leading man but he has good chemestry with Tyrese and they make a good buddy team. The cars and women make the movie good as well lol. It's not as serious as the first and doesn't have much of a drama feel to it at all like the first one did. The racing and other action scenes are handled well and this is a fun movie. The little Dukes of Hazard stunt at the end with the car flying on top of a boat is the only problem I had with the movie. It's not as good of an action climax as the film could've used. The confrontation between the heroes and the villain at the end is disapointing as well. The original had much more interesting characters and the end is better in thaht one too. 2 Fast 2 Furious has a lot more action and car chases though and they're entertaining."

This Had Me Thinking That Tyrese Is A Much Worse Actor But ... Was I Ever More Wrong. This Movie Was All Action And 0 Plot But Runs On It's Own. You Don't Need To Have Seen The First To See This. It Starts Off With An Adrenaline Pumping Car Chase Held By Ludacris's Charector Where Brian Jumps Over An Bridge. He Gets Arrested But Only To Get Asked To Help Find Carter Verone "" Cole Hauser "" And Get Him Caught.  Verone Isn't A Good Man. His Undercover Cop Girlfriend Is Pretending To Love Him The Whole Time But I Couldn't Help But Notice The Chemistry Between Her And Brian. Tyrese Plays Roman Pierce. He's Slick As Ever. Cole Hauser Made A Tottally Kicking Villain. Paul Walker Had Another Stellar Performance And... Eva Mendes Is Too Hot. Go See This And Enjoy. I Will Definetly Be First In Line When The DVD Is Released. Peace."

What really excites me about his film is that it's a sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. This movie is defintely cheesy and very very unbelievable. But hey I still enjoy it, it's refreshing seeing Paul Walker still young not like in the 4th movie and now 5th movie that's about to be released. Overall it's a fun cheesy film. Enjoy!"

"2006-08-19	2.0	0	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I've been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He's made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word ""bro"" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it's clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would've been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.Now you might be wonderning: who's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there's actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it's well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see ""Timeline"").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn't look so terrible, because everyone's focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there's even a sequel."								
"2003-11-15	3.0	0	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I didnt actually enjoy this movie as best as the first Fast and the Furious. Only because Vin Diesel isnt in this one, it doesnt seem to have the right &quot"	catch&quot	 to the movie. Thats just my opinion though because I think that Vin Diesel is a great actor. The whole plot of this movie is still good.						
"2014-05-15	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Let's start with the basics. The DVD was sealed and brand new as described and have had no problems with it whatsoever. As for the movie itself...if you love cars, girls, actions, and cars, then you'll love this movie. Although Vin Diesel isn't in this one, Paul Walker doesn't disappoint and the additions of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris complete a thrilling movie."

"2007-01-18	3.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious: 5/10: Okay so it's car porn. It's rather well done car porn. Stunningly brainless but rather fun in places 2 Fast 2 Furious gives us a candy colored version of street racing with a plot that is best not even discussed.After all you don't watch this for the plot. You watch it for the cars. A giant product placement for Mitsubishi among others the cars and characters are right out of a video game (the paint jobs match the personalities) and kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the CGI to a minimum. The movie made me want to trick out my old Dodge Dart.(Electric Blue paint job with matching neon on yeah baby).Director John Singletary moves the cars around like he has been directing Burt Reynolds's movies all his life. (This is not a criticism and the fact he avoids Cannonball Run style humor is another plus.) Singletary who usually films much more important movies, (what's next Scorsese's Jaws 5 or Spike Lee's Ella Enchanted 2 Ella in Da Hood? Actually the way some of Spike's recent films have gone this may not be a bad idea) keeps the pace tight and the actors attractive.However all is not peachy keen. For example I haven't seen African American hairstyles this bad since Cotton came to Harlem. The Tyrese character comes across as a complete idiot almost sinking the movie once or twice. (Now I know Tyrese can act I saw Baby Boy.) Another quick note I have driven cars with nitrous oxide and they give you a burst of acceleration not warp speed effects from Star Trek. (And lets face it the Mitishibishi cars are pretty but not fast. These cars are dragging down a strip after a minute and the speedometer finally moves from 90 to 120 my Dart has better acceleration after 60 sixty seconds.The movie, to its credit, acknowledges when the cars get whooped by some old American muscle. I know I promised not to discuss the plot but one thing. If you needed someone to drive a couple of million dollars from Miami to Key West (all of 2 hours on Interstate 95 and Route 1), would you A: hire and old couple in a RV B: Drive it yourself or C: Hire two ex-cons in the flashiest cars you have ever seen and who had to this point been incapable of rounding the block without causing an accident and attracting various state and local agencies. I guess that's why we are not criminal masterminds."								
"2009-04-10	3.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Two years after audiences made a surprise hit out of ""The Fast and the Furious"", Universal Pictures released the speed-injected sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". Gone were most members of the original film's cast, except for Paul Walker who opted to return once again as Brian O'Connor, and joining him this time would be then-newcomer to the acting world Tyrese Gibson (""Four Brothers""), Eva Mendes (""Ghost Rider""), and Cole Hauser (""Pitch Black""), along with director John Singleton (""Shaft"") filling up the director's chair in place of Rob Cohen.""2 Fast 2 Furious"" finds Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an ex-cop, living a life in hiding, yet still trying to prove just how fast he is in the world of street racing. But when the FBI catches up with Brian, he is given one final chance to do what is right by using his skills behind the wheel to assist in bringing down an international drug lord (Cole Hauser), or face the next few years behind bars. To do this Brian must enlist the aid of a former buddy (Tyrese Gibson) who is just as addicted to the rush of high velocities as he is, and hope that their combined racing prowess will be enough to get the job done before time runs out.With the original film, ""The Fast and the Furious"" audiences were given a movie that no one really had high expectations for, and in the end it became a massive hit for the summer of 2001. For ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" expectations were notably higher going in due to the great success of the original, but only having Paul Walker return for the sequel didn't seem to spell good things for this installment's future, at least not in my book. As it turns out I was wrong in my estimation that the missing element of Vin Diesel and most of the other cast members from the original would effect box office take, because ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" easily drove past where its predecessor finally parked on the box office tally sheet.The original film was essentially a story about loyalty between friends that live their lives on opposing sides of the law (as it turns out)"	 for the sequel writers Michael Brandt & Derek Haas ("Wanted") along with original writer Gary Scott Thompson tried to take that initial theme and expound upon it. The main thrust of this film rests upon the decisions Brian made over the course of "The Fast and the Furious", and how those decisions for better or worse have affected his life today. By taking this route, not only do the writers actually enrich the story for the first movie by adding some new layers after the fact to Brian's character, but also strengthening this film by linking it directly into the action of the original (something that many franchises forget to do, and at times causes a movie within a series to feel unrelated in a way that is detrimental to the franchise). I did enjoy how the story gave us insight into Brian's and Roman's (Tyrese Gibson) history, and made their relationship in this film a parallel to Brian and Dom in the original. It was also interesting to see a different side to Brian's character than we have before. In the first movie he was a cop, so he was bound by the law (to an extent)	 in this film, no such restriction is in place, and Brian is much more care-free and most likely being himself, thus making him a little more interesting as a character.As strengthened as the film was by its link to the original, it was also hurt by it because it forced the inevitable comparisons between the two films to come even more naturally. The script for this film did have some weaknesses that detracted from the end result, some of which were problems in the first movie, just not to the extent that they are here. Numerous times throughout the movie the dialogue began to grow tiresome, especially the pervasive uses of the words "Yo", "Bro", and "Check it", all of which seemed to find its way into almost every single moment of Paul Walker's screen time. I know that in the first movie he used these words, and that it kind of solidified his surfer image	 however, when it begins to become noticeable to the point that it's annoying, something has gone wrong. Along with that problem there were also several moments within the story that felt slow, as if the writers weren't really sure how to propel the story forward in an interesting way. It was at these times that the movie seemed to be meandering about aimlessly just waiting for the next action/racing sequence to begin so that the story could find its mojo once more. It was due to these problems, and a few other minor ones along the way, that caused "2 Fast 2 Furious" to stumble along in places, and in the end fall short of the standard set by the first film.A staple of this series is of course the racing sequences, and there are a plethora of such scenes in this installment, all of which are fun to watch no doubt about that. Yet, the problem with a franchise such as this, or any action series for that matter, is that it becomes harder in the sequels to make the action (in this case racing) seem fresh and original. No matter how hard you try the racing is going to resemble that which came before it, unless you explore a new style of racing or just go completely unrealistic with the scenes (which appeared to happen in a few instances in this film). With this problem standing in his way director John Singleton did manage to at least make the racing interesting by including more stunts into the sequences than had been done before, some of which were a little harder to believe than others. It was this decision that helped keep the racing from feeling stale, yet also resulted in a more gimmicky feeling than the previous film's races had. Despite all that, director John Singleton did a very good job in trying to differentiate his movie from the original, while at the same time keeping a similar feel and tone. Not an easy task, but one that he managed to succeed in doing.As I stated earlier Paul Walker was the only primary cast member to return for this installment, and I had praised him previously for his work in the original film. However, for this movie he seemed unfocused and uninterested through several of his scenes, almost as if he were simply "phoning in" his performance. I'm not saying that Paul is the greatest actor of his generation, far from it actually, but his apparent aloofness to the material, and at times wooden portrayal, was very distracting. Despite the problems that Paul had in his role, there were several moments within the film where he actually came out of his funk, and delivered some very key scenes	 namely those revolving around his past mistakes and how they have effected his decisions and choices ever since.Joining Paul Walker we have actor Tyrese Gibson, who has become quite a decent actor in his own right since this film. Now, his performance in this movie is troubled like Paul Walker's, but for different reasons. Unlike Paul, Tyrese clearly enjoys his role, and seems to really be trying to invest himself in the performance	 however, his talent had not yet been honed enough to let him fully deliver in all his scenes. This is best illustrated by what is easily one of the worst line readings within this film, and reminds me of Hayden Christensen's horribly flat utterance of the words "Don't underestimate my power!" in "Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith", which is, "I have a problem with authority." Wow, could a line be delivered any flatter and with any less conviction, obviously it could be if Hayden had delivered it, but still that was atrocious and by all accounts should have resulted in another take to try to get it right (take note director John Singleton).Alongside the two leads is actress Eva Mendes as an undercover FBI agent working inside the drug cartel. Eva was very good in this role, and had the good fortune of actually receiving a female character that was given more to do in this film than Michelle Rodriguez or Jordana Brewster was in the first one. Cole Hauser as the drug lord gave a decent performance, and seemed to do the best he could with what he was given to work with. The problem with his character was that he wasn't really a guy that was all that interesting, and truth be told he seemed more like a stock villain from any other action film. I know that the main focus for this series will always be the cars, but a little effort could have been put into making this villain a little more of a threat and much more developed as a character. Truthfully, even though we rooted for him, Vin Diesel's character Dom was in essence a bad guy in the original movie, but it was the way his character was developed to be a more complicated guy than what you merely see on the surface that made him so interesting. That is what was sorely lacking in this movie's villain	 I'm not saying you need a villain that you can root for, but at least give me one that isn't so one-dimensional.All that being said, for me "2 Fast 2 Furious" was a generally fun ride with plenty of high-energy racing, a decent story, and average acting for the most part (with a few bright spots here and there)	 however, the movie never did quite capture what made the first one such a success, so it does fall somewhat short in the end."2 Fast 2 Furious" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.	
"2003-06-28	3.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Now, a lot of my friends told me that this movie had no plot.  I beg to differ.  It DOES HAVE A PLOT - a lousy one.  A recycled plot that I believe I saw once in a made for TV movie.  This movie is like the legendary Tin Man - all metal and chrome - but no heart.  The only times I really liked this movie were the races (which thankfully there are more in this one than in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS), the beautiful autos, and that one scene with the rat (I tried that on Josh when I got home).  As always Paul Walker can't act.  If I didn't know any better, I'd swear they had to write his lines on his steering wheel most of the time.  Tyrese had the almost impossible challenge of replacing bald strong-man (and the reason the first movie had the word FURIOUS in the title) Vin Diesel.  He failed miserably.  I believe he and Walker went to the same acting school for ""pretty but stupid actors"" that Ashton Kutcher and Freddy Prinze Jr. nearly flunked out of.  The only really good performance in the entire movie was that of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (I'm sorry but the Spyder ... too.  It was overacting.)  The fight scene between Brian and Rome made me feel like I was watching two ten year olds fighting.  Fortunately for the filmmakers and the actors, another installment is probably in the works because they know just as well as we do that the only real reason anyone comes out to see this movie is for the spectacular cars.  So as long as they keep the screen looking more like an Auto Show than a movie, they can keep putting butts in seats.  If you like fast cars and scantily-clad women, and you're willing to endure Paul Walker's lack-of-talent without vommitting up your greasy popcorn, then by all means please enjoy."

"2003-06-14	4.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	First of all, before I get on with the movie itself, let me point out my only rant going to see this movie. I really liked the first &#65533"	Fast and the Furious&#65533	 (besides the soundtrack, but I&#65533	ll get touch on that aspect in a minute). It had enough there to make a sequel. How it ended was how Vin Diesel got away in Mexico (if you had watched the closing credits, you would see a scene where Vin Diesel driving along the Mexican border.) My first thoughts were the producers would start from there. When I heard about them making a sequel, I figured they were going to do it that way. When I heard Diesel wasn&#65533	t going to be in it, I ranted. Even though I don&#65533	t care for Vin Diesel all that much, a good portion of the movie&#65533	s greatness came from Vin Diesel and Paul Walker&#65533	s performance. It was like a team effort, and not having that caused this new sequel to fail on some aspects of its original basis. With that said, let me tell you my thoughts of &#65533	2 Fast 2 Furious&#65533
"2004-06-13	2.0	5	6	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	The original FAST AND THE FURIOUS was brainless but reasonably entertaining, with a charismatic performance by Vin Diesel, a fairly interesting plot, and some very well-done action scenes. This inevitable sequel, starring Paul Walker (who played second fiddle to Diesel's character in the original) and Tyrese (as Diesel's &quot"	replacement&quot	), hardly approaches the highs of the first film at all until the last 20 minutes or so, when 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS truly comes alive with a fun-to-watch car chase scene, some ingenuity, and some momentum. Until then, it's pretty mediocre, with a cookie-cutter plot, some wince-inducing dialogue (which tries way too hard to be &quot	cool&quot	), and bland car racing scenes. Thanks to Tyrese, who brings considerable energy and charisma to a badly underwritten but important role, it's still fairly watchable overall, but at least with THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS I wasn't annoyed with the dialogue and bored with the plot. Action fans can easily skip this one.				
"2003-10-01	1.0	0	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	One day, some brainwashed, MTV moron came up with the idea to mix rap and street racing and put it in a movie. He gave us The Fast and The Furious. Boy, that movie was terrible. Now, he decides to make a sequel(Why?) and puts more rap in it, but this time, Ludacris shows up. I hope this Fast and The Furious trend dies off along with that dumb, &quot"	gangsta&quot	 rap trend.						
"2013-04-13	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie was great, probably just as good as the first movie! They are also such great actors!  I am watching the whole series."								
"2014-05-26	4.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I freely admit I wasn't a fan of the Fast & The Furious but with this entry into what has become a powerhouse of a series - you began to see what Brian was capable of and more importantly what kind of kickass storytelling was possible. Admittedly Dom/Vin isn't in this one but it by no means diminishes the power of Tyrese stepping up to the plate as Roman Pearce. Throw in Cole Hauser and Eva Mendez - you have a solid movie experience on your hands that showcases just what the future has in store."

"2013-05-26	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This sequel to ""The Fast And The Furious"" is better even without Vin Diesel in it. Paul Walker is back and better as ex-cop Brian O' Conner, who is now in a street racing gang. He is then arrested and is told about a druglord named Carter Verone, played with excellence by Cole Hauser. He takes the job, but, with help of his own, a old childhood friend Roman Pearce, played with nice commitment by Tyrese Gibson. I don't want to tell anymore because that will be giving away too much information. John Singleton, the director, is brilliant at directing this movie and this will surely be one of my favorites of his for all time. David Arnold's score is brilliant as much as the movie is."

But the question remains: Will this be yet another notch in the long string of thoughtless, cash-in sequels? Probably, since the notable lack of Cohen and Vin Diesel this time around. Sure, it'll clean up in cinemas, and who cares if whats-his-name isn't in it as long as it's got enough hot chicks, cool car chases and an ear-splitting soundtrack right? Yes, lower your expectations and it's sure to be a blast."

"2004-10-25	5.0	7	9	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	First, let me say that I decided not to watch this movie when it came out summer 2003. I was so turned off from the first one (Fast & the Furious) that I though the sequel will be a waste of time & money (most sequels tend to flop nowadays). The cars in the first movie were ok, but there was no plot...basically none...nada!! Not to mention Ja Rule only showed up in the movie to get dissed? lolol...serves him right. Fast & Furious was lame overall, but Vin Diesel stole the show (hands down). So, I'm disappointed that he wasn't in this sequel though.So I rented & watched the DVD 1yr later expecting to see another dumb sequel.I was wrong...This movie finally has a decent plot that gelled all parts of the movie together into one exciting rollercoaster ride.The cars, were much better, waaaaay faster, not to mention the girls and the setting (how can u beat Miami?). The first race totally blew me away. Incredible Car Stunts!! Not to mention the cars. Skyline? Spider? Evo VII? The 2 Hemi monsters? American Muscle?...What more cars could u ask for Man? They even rolled out the whole pack of cars near the end. The police aren't that stupid. It's just flat-out fast paced action from the word ""GO!"" The driving maneuvres during all chases were well done.Paul Walker's a pretty cool actor...I respect the man. Tyrese was just too funny. Eva Mendes is so pretty, that I've stopped dreaming of J-Lo. Ludacris & Devon Aoki look so cute together. Not to mention the villian (Cole Hauser), he was stoned cold. All the actors were tight.How can I forget the soundtrack? All the tracks are flat-out club bangers that fit the scenes like a glove. That track during the buildup to the 1st race (when the skyline was driving in) was my favorite. You'll be feeling the beats for real.To me this is one of the hypest movies I've seen that really lived up to it's name...definitely one of the best urban movies I've ever seen in a while now. You won't get tired of this movie, and you'll want to watch it over and over again. This movie is a keeper for all car-lovers.Should they do ""Fast & Furious 3"" with Vin Diesel back in with Paul Walker, Tyrese in it, true justice will be surely be served.This movie rocks! Why? It's all about the cars baby!"								
"2006-01-30	1.0	2	7	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed!"								
"2004-10-12	2.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	The original was a great movie, and really helped advocate the growing trend of import tuning & racing. The ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" sequel turned out to be a bogus attempt to take the original a step further. The thing that made the original so cool was that it was all about the cars and the racing scene (particularly LA/So. Cal). 2 Fast 2 Furious simply feels like another cop movie with chase scenes and a poor story.I've never seen a sequel bomb as badly as this one. It's too bad they didn't try harder to make this one a hit too. No wonder Vin Diesel didn't appear in this one: Apparently he can see a bad script a quarter-mile away.I'm glad I only rented this movie. If I would have paid full price to own it I would be forced to sell it to some poor unsuspecting fool. I have one more thing to say about this movie, and it is a possible spoiler so if you haven't watched it skip to the next review.The first scene was the worst of the whole movie, so it really failed to set the mood for the rest of the flick. Most of the first race was done by low-budget computer graphics, and it is painfully obvious. The steam from the Nissan Skyline's hood was just lame, BTW.Do yourself a favor, buy a different movie."								
"2003-08-18	3.0	0	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious was a movie like any other about cars, drugs, and more cars (and of course girls). However, Paul Walker's acting could have been a litte bit more convincing. It's a little more than obvious that his ebonics just did not work for his character. Next time, Paul, choose a part where you don't have to fake your entire dialogue."								
"2006-06-19	5.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	If you liked the first one, you have to like this one. It's good. It made me smile. It's funny but at the same time serious and sexy. The first one and the second fast and furious are the bomb."								
"2013-12-21	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I didn't think it would be this good since the original crew from the first movie isn't there but it's better. And I think it's due to the camaraderie and special bond between Paul Walker and Tyrese. There's plenty of action, jokes, semi- dramatic scenes but overall entertaining. I actually like it better then the first movie.When Paul was with Van Diesel it was more drama and action. In this movie it's action, comedy and drama all intermingled. It's the only film of the Fast and Furious series that I've seen ( seen only Fast and Furious 1,2 and 6) that I  am wiling to watch twice or thrice.I truly enjoyed it."

"2003-11-06	3.0	2	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I think that 2Fast2Furious didn't spend to much time on the moive. The rush everything to make sure when it was time to release the movie it would be done so the views could go out and see it. There where only 2 races in the whole movie and not to many cars to look at. To me The Fast and Furious kills this movie by far."								
"2003-05-24	5.0	1	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	wass up!! race addicts, thank god the much awaited movie TF&TF2 will be released on june 6 nationwide. i gave this movie a 5 star coz it really rocks and this is my favorite movie ever its like an energy booster to my body that keeps my whole system alive.GODSPEED!!"

However, I do have to say that I greatly missed Dom (V Diesel)...If you havent seen the first one, get them both and enjoy...The cars are awesome, the guys are hot, and the girls are beautiful. The one thing I did like better about this film is more American Muscle cars."								
"2005-11-11	5.0	4	7	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	ARE YOU CRAZY?????????This movie is great. I love boy racers and I wish I was old enough to drive so I could be one too! Oops, I'm a girl! OK, I could be a girl racer! But, boy racers or girl racers, this movie is da bomb! It's in a class of its own. My Dad loves car and motorbike racing. He saw the first five minutes and switched it off, saying it was stupid. Big mistake. Luckily, I recorded it so he can still watch it and see how wrong he was about it having no story! Of course it has a story, it just needs a bit more time than five minutes to really get into full swing! I loved the fast cars, and I can hardly wait to see the first one (hope it's just as good)!Just remember not to take part in Street Races on busy roads, and try to be as safe as possible. For, not only could you get caught, or get your car impounded, but you could also kill or injure yourself, or someone else, or wreck your car.But as long as you don't take it TOO seriously it's a great film. And I'm not saying don't street race. I'll bet it'd be great fun and I can hardly wait to do it myself! I'm just saying, be careful, be safe, and don't do it if you're drunk or stoned.But hey, enough of that! Let's now focus on the GOOD points.OK, so I suppose you're wondering what I'm talking about. Well, I'll tell you. 2 Fast 2 Furious is about some guys who take part in a street race. They get caught and they are promised clean records IF they help the police with another crime. Well, the criminals say that if they don't help them, they'll make up so many stories about them breaking the law they'll go to Jail. But if they do help them, they'll die. Well, they try to look like they're helping them when they're actually helping the police. Much mirth ensues.If you haven't already seen it, get down to the nearest video ezy and get one today! Satisfaction guaranteed!You'll love it if you liked The World's Fastest Indian, Herbie: Fully loaded (the old OR the new version), The Fast And The Furious (Duh! It's the first in the series!), or any other car/motorbike racing film.So what're you waiting for? HIRE ONE TODAY!"

I have to say John Singleton made this film his own giving us a great visual set piece in Miami. If only the ""Miami Vice"" film had what this  movie has going for it in the visual department it might be easy to watch."								
"2010-07-25	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Miami Vice meets Vin Diesel(not in this movie) in the second movie of the Fast&Furious series.

If you like cop movies and/or car chase movies, this is a must-have!"								
"2008-03-13	3.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Fans of the first film, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, may have felt that what it offered was nothing more than a career boost to co-star Vin Diesel. The fact is that it was a fun filled roller coaster ride that film goers flocked to. Hollywood, never one to not notice something like this, did what had to be done. They made this sequel.Now sequels are never looked upon very well by most critics. It is the rare occasion when they find any praise whatsoever. And as they go, this movie isn't quite as good as the original. But it still retains the fun and entertainment level of the first, sacrificing only a fraction of the serious undertones seen there.Having aided a felon escape at the end of the first film, officer Brain O'Connor (Paul Walker) is now on the run. Taking his tricked out car and heading down the road, he makes his way across the USA towards Miami. Using his driving ability, he picks up cash along the way as well as when he hits the south Florida streets. A bust after an illegal street race (using state of the art technology that shuts down a cars electric system), Brian is offered a chance to avoid jail time AND have his record wiped clean.All he has to do is go undercover again and find out how drug runner Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) is laundering the money he makes. With an agent already in deep cover, they assign a newbie to Brian. Demonstrating how inept he is, Brian insists on recruiting his own backup.Change of location to Barstow where an old friend of Brian's is racing. Roman Pearce (Tyrese) holds a grudge against Brian for not helping him after Brian became a police man. But being offered the chance to have his record cleared and removed from house arrest, he jumps at the opportunity.The pair has a chance to prove themselves right away as Verone sets up a contest for drivers to return with a package. The high speed race is on and of course, the dynamic duo wins. Now working for Verone, they are given a job to transport a package (the money) for him. Problems involving Verone's trust of his close personal assistant who also happens to be the deep undercover agent (Eva Mendes) results in a set up for Brian and Roman. Combine that with a stereotypical overzealous FBI agent (James Remar) and you have a predictable yet fun movie.The charm of this movie is not the in depth look at social problems facing today's youth gone wild that results in their fascination in hot looking cars and illegal street races. Leave that for another film, perhaps a documentary. No, the charm of this film lies in two things. The actors and the cars.Walker and Tyrese fit well together, making their friendship believable. The ease with which they slide into their characters is fast and fun and filled with plenty of humor as well. The sign of a good actor is one who makes it appear as if he is not acting. And both of them do that well here.The cars? What can I say? These are some of the most ticked out vehicles on the planet. Filled with everything from televisions to computer assists to neon and chrome, each one is almost a character in itself. They look wicked and hot and lethal all at once.A few side stories involving friends and more street races fill out the basic plot of the movie. But everything continues to focus on the cars and the leads. And in the end that's all that matters. This is not a heavy duty drama. This is a popcorn flick, pure and simple. And as far as that goes, it fills bucket after bucket."								
"2014-03-04	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This is the movie that truly hooked me onto the series. It is in the second movie that I developed my attachment to the characters. Their personalities become more distinct and the viewer cares about each more. I felt that Vin Diesel and Paul Walker started to really become the Fast and Furious icons in this movie. These are the best car lover movies out there because they do it right with an in depth plot, family ties, beautiful scenery, love, and the best cars."								
"2013-05-31	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Thanks for the movie that includes Eva Mendes and has the Miami nightlife and cars, cars, cars, for those of us who like that kind of Fun.

"2003-09-25	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I really wanted to see this movie until it said it got rated in my local paper 2 stars. 2 STARS! I was then maybe thinking about seeing it and then decided to go for the heck of it. It was awesome! The story plot was pretty good, and there was a lot of action. Typically what every 13-18 year old wants to see. Recomended to action lovers and all teens"								
"2004-08-31	2.0	0	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Come back Vin Diesel. Diesel turned down this film because he wanted more money, bad mistake. ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" made almost as much money as the first one in the box-office. This film was entertaining, the girls were hot, but I left the theater, wanting more."								
"2004-01-21	2.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	There was a lot more street racing in this, but it sucked. Suki? Who thought of that genius character. She seemed so bad at acting. Maybe it was because her dialogue sucked! This whole movie is bland though. When you hate the characters, you hate the movie. I hated the characters, and you will too."

"2003-11-08	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This film was awesome, one defo for the thrill seekers.  Just sit back and enjoy the thrill of the race!  Excellent visuals and special effects and I ain't just talking about those fast cars either, I mean the hot fast men too.  Paul Walker is to die for a total babe-magnet - sex on a stick!! mmmmmmmmmmmm! He is a very talented actor and oozes charisma and charm.  He keeps your eyes glued to the screen and your bott firmly on yer seat. Tyrese's character Roman, is a lovable rogue whose boyish charm and sexy smile leave you wanting more. It also had an element of playground humour between Brian (Paul) and Roman (Tyrese), which was comical at times, this also made it fun to watch.  A definite MUST SEE!!!!!!!!"								
"2003-06-06	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I was the second person in line at the box office , there were 20 people behind me to see this movie. I thought that if it was anything like the first one it had to be good. But it wasn't like the first one, It was better. It was one of those movies that you couldn't leave to get popcorn, use the bathroom, ect. My opinon is that Tyrese made the film better than Vin Diesal, but it has to have Paul in it. I am looking forward to hopefully see another repeat of 2F&2F."								
"2003-10-02	4.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Fast paced with lots of action.  Way better than the first one.  Tyrese and Paul Walker have great chemistry together.  If you liked a movie like Cradle To The Grave you are going to love this.*Wanted to give it 3 and a half stars not four."								
"2003-06-10	4.0	13	16	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Fueled by the libidinous gas of Tyrese and Paul Walker, John Singleton's sequel to ""The Fast and the Furious,"" ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" proves that Fast Cars, Fast Guys and Fast Women can still equal a pretty good movie. We're not talking ""The Hours"" or ""Talk to Her"" here, but I can think of several more expensive to make and/or bigger star vehicles that don't have this movie's charisma and charm.""2F2F"" is shot in Caribbean, super bright primary colors and the Car race and chase scenes are as outstanding as those in ""Ronin"" and that is saying a lot. And even though some of the line readings are dull and non-ironic, Tyrese definitely emerges as a genuine talent.If there are any Drive-ins left in the world (and I hope there are)...this is the perfect drive-in movie: take a date, buys some dogs, popcorn, good-and-plenty and a vat of Soda and enjoy."								
"2003-10-15	2.0	0	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Vin Diesel was right to stay out of this one. It flopped big time when I watched it in the theaters. I was so bored. yeah, ok, cars speeding there, he jumps a gap in the bridge, ok. lame action. not even close as better to the first one. the first one had style and ok Ludacris is in this one but who cares about him, hes not a good actor. Ja Rule outacted him in the first one, Ja Rule was way much better then him"								
"2003-12-29	2.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	When the original The Fast and the Furious opened in theaters back in 2001, it looked to be just another action flick to keep teenagers happy at the movies until the next big hit entered the multiplexes. But The Fast and the Furious became a much bigger then anybody expected, especially its distributor, Universal Pictures. The original film, which cost only $38 million for the studio, ended its run in theaters with over $110 million. The surprise hit of the summer became an even bigger surprise on DVD. The film became one of the largest selling DVDs in the year it was released. So with these results in hand, it was a no brainer for Universal to make a follow up. Unfortunately things didn't go the way Universal would have liked it. Rising-star Vin Diesel, who got his break out role in the original The Fast and the Furious, wanted a much bigger paycheck then Universal was willing to pay. So in the end, he ended up dropping out of the project. After Diesel dropped out, Rob Cohen, director of The Fast and the Furious, also dropped out of the sequel. But since Universal still had Paul Walker, the other star of the original, they decided to go on with the sequel without them. Will the risk pay off for Universal or will this high-octane thrill ride run out of gas?The story goes that street racing is a big thing in the city of Miami. Watching tricked out cars race up and down the street and seeing who crashes and who crosses the finish line is a huge thrill with the people of Southern Florida. One of the big stars of the street racing scene is Brian O'Conner, who last time we saw him was racing out in Los Angles with Vin Diesel as an undercover cop. But since he let the criminal go, he was forced to leave the police department. When he is caught by the police, he is recruited by them to track down a cruel Miami import/export dealer. When O'Conner doesn't like the partner the police team him up with, he recruits an old friend, Roman Pearce, to help him track down the dealer so they can get their records cleaned. The story for 2 Fast 2 Furious is one of the most ridiculous ones pulled out of a movie. It is certainly as worse or even more horrible then the one for the original film. Some elements are ridiculous crafted into the film and some of the chases scenes are set up in a way that are too predictable. The absence of director Rob Cohen is clearly obvious with the sequel. Though the original wasn't a movie masterpiece, Cohen had at least some consistency. This film lacks that very dearly.The characters of 2 Fast 2 Furious are, for the most part, just stereotypes. The rest that are not, don't do a great job acting through this tired script. Paul Walker, who didn't receive too many fabulous comments about his acting, or lack there of, in the original film, doesn't do much better in the follow up but one can see improvement. The only one in the cast that shows some sign of rising acting talent is Tyrese Gibson, who plays O'Conner's ex-con buddy, Roman Pearce. Tyrese brings a lot of well needed humor is this film that is, for the most part, fairly dry. Most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning. Devon Aoki who plays Suki in the film isn't given much outside of the look badass and hot at the same time argument. She has no important lines and really doesn't do much with her role in the first place. She is basically there just for show. Same goes for Eva Mendes, though her character obviously places a more important role. But on a technical note, her character really doesn't do too much. The rest of the cast, like it was said before, isn't worth mentioning.Overall, 2 Fast 2 Furious is not much of an improvement from the original but did we really expect it to be? Without the badass charm of Vin Diesel and the consistency of Rob Cohen at the helm, the project suffers greatly. The story is tired, dry and too predictable as the film progresses. For what was accomplished in the film, if anything at all, the film could have been wrapped up much quicker then the two hours it ran in. Nothing really stands out to take of big note within the film outside of the rising acting power of Tyrese Gibson. The film focuses too much on the scantily clad babes and the adrenaline powered cars to hear how ridiculous the script actually sounds. When they finish talking their ""street lingo"", the lines they pop out sound cheesy and dry. But one does have to admit that with all the problems the film suffers from, the racing scenes are very well done. The special effects, as impressive as they are, still look pretty fake, which is pretty obvious. The charm of the original, if that was possible for some, was the realistic racing scenes. Most of those in the sequel are done on computer with only the actors placed in motionless cars against a blue screen in order to add the CGI later on. This was possibly the biggest disappointment of the film with nothing else expected from the sequel. The month of June looks bad enough with four horrible duds opening up next weekend but with a start like 2 Fast 2 Furious, there is only one thing to say: Disney and Pixar should make a real killing with Finding Nemo this month."								
"2003-08-23	3.0	2	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious is an extremly exciting movie. It has all the special effects and car races any movie goer could ask for. Unfortuantly the bad acting and weak plot hurts the movie drastically. The movie is about Paul Walker (after being dismissed from his police job) living in Florida and getting money off illegal street racing. When he is finally caught by the Miami Police for street racing, he makes a deal with them that if he will bring down a drug lord he will be able to walk freely and have a cleared resame. He recruits Tyrese his former friend and they hit the streets of Miami to take down the drug dealer.The plot of the movie is extremely boring. Anyone who came to the movie doesn't really want to see a plot, they just wanna see a few people race cars, hot women and for Paul Walker to provide decent acting. Unfortuantley they only ge 2 out of 3. Walkers acting continues to hurt the franchise and he's even worst in 2 fast 2 furious. He not even believeable with half the things he says. Young actor Tyrese is pretty good however and saves the acting. He provides numerous comedic lines and keeps the flow of the movie going. Rapper Ludacris also has role in the movie as the money collector and money disher outer when the races begin and end (if that makes sense.) The visuals in the movie are quite spectacular. The race scenes are excellently done making you feel like your really in the drivers seat stepping on the gas.All in all the movie is okay but is only worth a rent when it comes out (I based the review on it in theatres) on video/dvd. The lack of a true lead actor hurts the movie (because lets face it Paul Walker isn't anywhere near good) and the weak plot doesnt help. Vin Deasil (or however you spell his name) needs to come back and help the look of a 3rd installment of The Fast and The Furious (if there is one.) Michelle Rodriguez would be nice too. Personally I recommend it."								
"2013-05-12	3.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious I feel is a bit of a step down from the first movie, Fast and the Furious, which is saying something.  Fast and the Furious was hardly a masterpiece, but it was a fun popcorn film that knew what it was, and what its target audience was.  This film still has those fun popcorn elements, but without the star power.  2 Fast 2 Furious is one of the highest rated entries in the Fast franchise.  I personally do not see why.  Out of all the Fast films this movie is probably one of my least favorites along with Tokyo Drift.The characters this time around were quite non-engaging.  The first film at least had Vin Diesel, who I am a fan of.  You also had Michelle Rodriguez, despite not having a big role.  Here Vin Diesel and Michelle are replaced with Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce, who I did not care for.  Gibson came of as overly obnoxious and quite annoying.  I know it is supposed to be part of his character, but I still found him annoying and not charming at all.  You also have Chris Bridges playing a character named Tej, who I did not care for much either.  Eva Mendes' character is also quite boring.  She really does not do much, and is mostly there as a token love interest for Brian.Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Connor.  Like the first film, I think he is alright, but he cannot really carry a film by himself.  In the first film you have Vin Diesel as a secondary lead.  Plus the supporting characters were more fun.  Here all the characters minus Paul Walker were boring and irritating at times.The villain I will say, of all the villains in the Fast films, he is the most memorable, though that is not saying much.  The Fast films have never had interesting villains, this one included.  The villains just seem like an afterthought.  They seem like just an excuse for cool car chases and races to happen.  This film is no exception, though compared to the other films, I find this villain to be the strongest.The action and car chases are still cool and fun like the first movie.  It seems like they were mostly practical.  I did not notice much CGI which is a plus for the film.Overall, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a letdown sequel and one of the worst of the Fast films.  I do recommend watching this if you are interested in the following films.  If you do not see this first you might be a bit confused."

The woman in the movie (Eva Mendes), is possibly one of the hottest creatures ever created by God! Any fan of the first movie will enjoy this one as well.

"2004-04-11	1.0	3	6	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I can not begin to talk about how today's youth are drawn to franchises.  I would love to start on the bad acting.  But, then, I would have to get at the plot that was most likely stolen from the mind of some shallow teenager.  That would make me talk of how this is just a real expensive commercial for foreign car parts.  I just want to leave the people with one thing to say about the bad movie with a worse title.  The chicks are hot."								
"2003-06-11	4.0	5	7	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I have to admit that I had my doubts about this sequel when I realized that Vin Diesel was not going to be a part of the cast. I had even bigger doubts when I found out that Tyrese was going to be in the movie (I always doubt singers turned actors). But I must say that I really enjoyed ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".In this film, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), a former cop, enlists the help of childhood friend, Roman Pearce (Tyrese), to bring down a very wealthy and highly dangerous criminal in Miami.The cars are faster, the people and locations are more beautiful, and the story is much lighter than the original. There is much more humor thanks to Tyrese and Ludacris, another music artist who gives a great performance!I would suggest seeing this film. It's definitely one you don't want to miss!!!"

"2004-06-23	2.0	3	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious is a stupefying glance into Hollywood.  It seems to represent a new kind of filmmaking where the bare minimum will do, revealing a real contempt for even the popcorn movie audience.The film shouldn't be expected to do much to begin with.  If you ever saw the preview, you'd think it was supposed to be stupid, summer fun.  There's nothing wrong with that, everyone grew up with popcorn summer movies in their lives, whether it was the 70s, 80s, 90s, whatever.  But this is a new chapter, I think.  The line between good video games and movies like this has been completely blurred.  I found the film so inept in even the intended aims, that I sat open-mouthed, speechless, watching the film unfold in what seemed like three times its actual length.I don't know where to begin.  The first film was what it was, a summer popcorn movie with fast, silly street machines racing, Vin Diesel inventing a career, and that was about it.  A sequel was almost a no-brainer, indeed.First off, I'm in disbelief that this was directed by John Singleton.  A promising young black director back when Boyz in the Hood appeared, he has now been completely neutralized by Hollywood.  After all, why should white directors have a monopoly on crap?  I can only hope Singleton was paid well for his troubles, as I believe his does have some talent.The film takes place in Miami, where the 'hero' of the original, no longer a copy, is now living a subsistence life street-racing.  He gets involved with some Cuban drug barons and an old friend who wound up in jail, etc, etc.  It doesn't matter.  The story and plotting are so ludicrous, it doesn't matter.  There isn't even an attempt at credibility, so I guess some credit is deserved.  In fact, the only way to really watch a movie like this and even try to enjoy it is to completely disregard any story or plot, and just trust that the dots somehow connect, at least on paper.  Speaking of Ludacris, he appears as some kind of heavily-connected gangsta thug who promotes these street races in neighborhoods the cops don't even bother patrolling.But the main draw of the film is the car chases, and the cars.  And I have to say, even in this, they've pretty much failed to deliver.  Yes, there are some wild street machines.  And there are plenty of chases.  But only a couple of stunts impress at all.  There appeared to be so much trickery involving the scenes, it was disappointing and lame.  The opener says it all.  I don't know how they've done it, but the shots of the drivers in their cars look very fake and processed.  Sure, I know the actors aren't driving, but you can tell digital fakery was involved, and if you look closely, there is a dearth of scenery from real, actual, impressive stunt driving.  It looks boring, and that's the real crime.The acting is appalling on all fronts.  The only person of any note or credibility is James Remar, character actor extraordinaire, always with a menacing face.  He has a side role. The two main stars are so bad, the film at times resembles a reading for the film, as opposed to the film.  They both look like male models saying lines, and indeed, at least one of them is.If you like video games, go and play Midnight Club Street Racing 2, or Burnout and its sequels, because they are the equivalent of watching this film.  No, they're better, because you can control them, and end them when you wish.  That it can't even deliver on the very simple, guilty-pleasure front it looks to be on is the real crime of 2 Fast.Not recommended, except if you're a car addict, and at least the film has a lot of extras."								
"2013-08-12	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This one is really fun.  Think I enjoyed it even more the second time, and it's nice to revisit the characters before they've been through all the more recent stuff. Watch it if you're a fan of the series."								
"2004-01-06	4.0	3	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Are you looking for street racing again?You may be a bit disappointed in this second Fast &amp"	 Furious movie. But it is a definitely better quality and more exciting movie. 2 Fast 2 Furious obviously has a much stronger storyline without repeating the same one as the previous movie. Even missing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker still able to drive this second movie to the peak. Very good one. Cann't wait for the third one to coming out.							
"2013-07-30	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie is the back bone of Paul Walker history in the story, need to have this movie to complete the whole story, if you like Fast Five, you would like this one."

"2003-11-08	1.0	1	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie starts out with some pimp stuff...Paul Walker is a true pimp...I think he is about the worst actor ever to be born on earth...Without Big Vinny it is a pretty sad movie...Maybe if Vinny was in it, it could be a really great movie...See what really happens is that Aliens take over Paul Walkers body and some really wicked things happen...I will now give you a few examples like a bomb blows up in the best car ever the cadi, it is like crazy and this other guy named tyress...I don't really know about this guy but he is not the bomb...He just needs to stick to singing...I really never watched this movie because i was half wasted and then totally wasted in the first 5 mins of the movie...I drank this like big keg of beer on sat and then smoked like a mofo and could not even open my eyes at Blockbuster...it was crazy i ate this footlong hotdog last weekend...I thought i would tell you all that cuz i know you all love HOT DOGS...The movie that gets five stars ***** is Finding Nemo it is about a pissed off fish that kills these guys who were fishing in this pond and this fish out of no where comes and eats these guys out of the middle earth like in the Lord of the Rings or maybe Ringu about some chinese people who watch this movie and DIE!!!! Maybe if the Lord of the Rings had Paul Walker it would make it HORRIBLE just like the movie Fast and whatever 2...Go see something that really ROCKS like the school of hard rock...Just go to the movie store and buy anything except this horrible movie...ROCK on Johnny Knoxville you were great in Jack something...you a crazy guy and you know what i really wanna see Elf i heard it was great...Talk to ya later the movie guy"								
"2003-09-15	5.0	2	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This Movie will have your heart beating FAST and FURIOUS yet again. This movie takes place in Miami and has some of the most AMAZING Heart pounding RACING on screen just as the original movie did. The movie is about an X cop on the run played by PAUL WALKER (Varsity Blues & The Joy Ride) who decides to go undercover to uncover a drug deal after having his arm twisted by the cops. He askes for his childhood pal played by buff Tyrese to be his partner. If the two can uncover the drug deal they will both get their records with the cops cleared and have a new chance for a fresh start. This is one of those movies that will have you on the edge of your seat. I give this movie 5 stars. Not art, but good Acting, Great racing sequences and a great flick!"

"2003-12-30	1.0	0	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	We got this as a gag gift for X-mas.  Yes. It's that bad.  I Don't know anything about cars, but I do know that the dudes shift gears like 20 times in one straighaway and I don't think cars have that many gears do they?  Also - there are many scenes where people aren't wearing seatbelts.  This is supposed to be marketed to young people, and I don't mind the illegal racing, but at least wear your freakin seatbelts people!  I know street racing is alive and well, but the movie doesn't seem very realistic - they weren't even winning enough money to cover the damages on their cars from the race!  Anyway - the acting is bad, as to be expected in a movie more about cars than people. And I was a little dissapointed that dude didn't get the girl in the end - what's up with that?"

"2003-06-15	1.0	2	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I never laughed so hard until I saw 2F2F.  While in the theater I accidently stood up several times, pointed my finger at the screen and yelled something to the effect ot ""HAHA you stupid ricers"".The movie is so unrealistic I have no clue why the liberal media is moaning that this movie is promoting street racing, that's just Darwin at work.Why is it unrealistic?  Why would people put 800 pounds of junk like stereo equipment and playstations on a race car.  Weight robs speed.Also I love the ricer graphics.  If you need a good laugh, see this movie!The acting was ok, the stunts were ok, the women were ok nothing spectacular except the nice, huge & comfy leather seats at the cinema."

"2012-11-19	3.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Its hard to believe this movie is so old the first time i watched it was at a drive in. Do drive in movies even exist anymore?Anyway 2 Fast 2 Furious when it came out and i saw it i absolutely loved it Walker and Gibson worked really well together and Eva was her usual beautiful self. The acting itself wasn't bad and the movie itself was fluid and easy to understand. Many people were expecting it to reference the original more but i think this film was trying to be more like life. When caught up in a tough situation most people dont have the time to sit down and have flashbacks. While it is true the past will come up and bite you and people can dredge up the past this film was attempting to be like real life and not live in the past.The humor in this film consists of mostly one liners that will make you chuckled and laugh. Its a true action movie keeping the drama and moments where silly things happen that would deliver side splitting humor to a minimum. The car chases in this film are long and for the most part very eventful basically everything you would expect from a hollywood car chase.The plot is simple to follow and for the most part well pieced together. The cars in the film are cool looking for the period however i think street racing look of cars have come a long way in the years since.This film does have everything needed for a street racing film- Nice cars- Races- Good guys- Bad guys- Car chases- The law- Shootouts- An abundance of half nude womenHowever even with all that those looking for this to be a sequel to the first one would be disappointed. This film should be looked at as a racing movie of its own right that makes few brief references to the first one.The film isn't bad, its fairly good 3/5 stars for those who aren't looking for a sequel. Those who are would likely give it a 2/5 star rating."								
"2003-12-21	5.0	2	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Anyone who says part one was way better is smokin somethin crazy. I had to force myself to like the first one. It tried to be a street racing movie but only had one race through the whole movie! This one has way better stunts, way more racing, hotter girls, better location, and the best part is there is no Vin Diesel. Whoever thought that guy could pass for an actor should be slapped. Tyrese comes in for his first major role and does great. He is super funny and you can tell in the acting that Paul Walker had a much better time acting with him in this one. The story behind the movie is all that irritated me. While busting a drug lord seems cool I think they should have kept it closer to the racing, which is the one way part one is superior. The soundtrack is way better in this one. It has no one from Murder Inc. in it which is a good thing, and its just packed with some of the best hip hop tracks I've heard all year. I really hope they make a third one."								
"2003-06-09	5.0	2	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Omg this one killed the first one. Everyone was all skeptical about it since Paul Walker was the only returning main actor. But forget all that cuz this one corrected all the mistakes that the first one made. More racing, more action, and actual plot,hotter girls, better racing scenes, better cars, and way better acting performance from Paul Walker. So overall this movie kicked... Go see it if you love racing like me."

"2003-10-04	2.0	13	19	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	""2Fast 2Furious"" is the only film I can remember that is guilty of committing two hyperboles in a single title.  There's nothing particularly fast nor particularly furious - unless you count the audience - about this sequel to ""The Fast and the Furious,"" the original box office sensation that really wasn't all that great to begin with but which looms up like an action movie ""War and Peace"" when placed up against this installment.  And what, may I ask, has happened to John Singleton?  Is this really the best the director of ""Boyz `n the Hood"" has to offer?The plotting is little more than an excuse to spin out a series of interminable and mind-numbingly boring race sequences, none of which score very high on the credibility meter.  Particularly ludicrous is a scene featuring a Florida drug kingpin, - whom one would naturally assume would want to be keeping as low a public profile as possible as he goes about conducting his business - who instead sends a bunch of his boys out to wreak havoc and splatter carnage all along the freeway simply to determine which of them would be the most reliable driver to help him sneak his laundered money out of the country!  Indeed, the overall storytelling is so messy that one can't even figure out who is chasing who after awhile.  Moreover, the ""acting"" consists basically of people hanging tough and strutting their stuff ad nauseam.""2Fast 2Furious"" can't even account for its badness by pleading low aspirations.  After all, ""American Graffiti"" was also a movie about ""people driving their cars.""  But oh what a difference between that film and this!"								
"2004-03-09	1.0	14	24	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I was absolutely SHOCKED when I saw that a director with the ability of John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood, Poetic Justice, Higher Learning) had crafted this mess.There is just no plot, no script, sub-par effects, and atrocious acting.  When are people going to learn that Paul Walker's hair can't carry a movie.  If I heard him say ""'bro"" one more time I was going to throw my TV out a window.If you have the option, just lay out the money to go to a car show.  You'll get to wander around as long as you want looking at all the tricked-out super-cars without all that annoying ""movie"" thing to get in the way."

John Singleton is horrible and should immedietly be deported to the former Soviet Union.Lame cars, action, lame everything. Go rent Hooper instead."

"2003-11-27	2.0	0	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is a sloppy sequel of an original that was no masterpiece in its own right. The cars are arguably just as whatever-you-want-to-call-them, but the chases aren't, and the plot suffers from a severe case of reduced star wattage: Vin Diesel lended his dome for the first movie, then skipped town in favor of the ""xXx"" series. Actor/singer Tyrese and his dome fills in, but the inherent ""Vinness"" of the maiden road race has left the building.Paul Walker's back, though, as Brian O'Connor, the most unconvincing cop to ever breathe air, only now he's been disavowed from the force for letting Vin's character escape and select another movie franchise. No badge in hand, Brian roams Miami, street race hustlin, catching the eye of a federal agent (Eva Mendes) who puts him undercover to land a major drug kingpin (Cole Hauser, channeling ""Miami Vice""). Tyrese plays Roman, Brian's former buddy with an unclear grudge. Roman and Brian pose and paw and return smoldering glares at one another to such an extent it's possible to read the film with homoerotic subtext.What an uninspired, pedestrian movie. ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" features Ludacris as a chop shop owner who does not seem to work - he emcees a jet ski race, though - and talentless model Devon Aoki as a street racing tart. Mendes is the flavor of the month but there's something curiously asexual and detached about her.At least Singleton has enough integrity left spare the audience needless gratuity."

"2013-11-22	4.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	It is exactly what you want sometimes: mindless viewing, but with a plot (somewhat), pretty people and quippy lines.  However, I did miss the glower of Vin (he is not in this one).  The cars are painted very silly pastels, which I kind of loved against the macho gangster backdrop.  There are wonderful side characters, which you wish would come back, but since I started this series at Five, I know that they don't make it that far.  I am not a car girl, nor a speed freak, but these movies always provide an amusing escape."

What the hell is with the titles, do it right, Fast and the Furious 2, there, it's fine. Biker Boys. There it's fine. People working on this project are dumb. And also what the hell is up with all the rappers and hip-hop music people in the movie business? They don't belong. They belong in the music business and actors belong in the movie business.

"2003-12-10	1.0	2	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie showed us a whole new level of bad movies.  From the unrealistic car scenes, to the abundant plot holes this movie has you falling asleep from the beginning.  The first movie showed us that nitrous can make a car slightly faster, but the second movie showed us that nitrous will allow you to reach light speed somehow.  When the cars in this movie use nitrous it somehow has the same effect as the space ships do in Star Wars when they travel through light speed.  When anyone seems to use nitrous everything gets kind of burry and all you see are streaking lights like Star Wars uses. All the car scenes in this movie are totally unrealistic.  The fact that we are supposed to believe that an EVO and an Eclipse are going to stand a prayer next to a Saleen Mustang, a Dodge Viper, and a Corvette Z06 is very insulting to anyone in the automotive world. The plot in this movie leaves nothing to the imagination as we are supposed to believe that this Paul Walker guy turns up missing and the police are after him, but then the next thing we know he is working for the police with his buddy who was also running from the law at one point.  This is a movie that you want to miss!"

"2007-07-23	3.0	0	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I might potentially have groupie tendencies when it comes to Tyrese. Pretty much any movie that he's put in, I'm going to track run to the show to see.  To put in one of my other favorite things to look at (cars) only complimented the movie more.  The cop in ""The Fast and the Furious"" is on the lookout to arrest some dealers and needs some manpower to help him out.  He comes up on an ex-con and a past friend, Tyrese's character, to help him fight the bad guys.  Again, I don't get into action movies, but pretty much every time Tyrese came on set, I was all eyes and ears.  I didn't really get into Eva Mendez's character and the end of the movie was way too Hollywood for me, but the building of the plot, and again the cars, helped it out some.  I was also delighted to see Ludacris in this one."

"2004-03-02	4.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) was kicked off the force for his little stunt in the Fast and the Furious and has been on the run ever since.  He fled all the way to Florida, where he became friends with Tej (Ludacris), the man who knew where all the action was.  Before too long, Brian couldn't even find anyone who would race against him and word was out.  The cops grabbed Brian and made him an offer - help them with a case or go to jail.  The cops have been trying to nab the premier drug dealer in the area, Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), for some time, but haven't been able to make anything stick.  Conveniently, Mr. Verone is looking for some drivers to make drops for him and that is where Brian comes in.  Brian takes the deal, but on one condition - this his buddy, Roman Pierce (Tyrese), gets a piece too.  Before they know it, Brian and Roman are in way over their heads as they combat fellow street racers, sexy undercover cops, an insane boss who is not above torture and the fast, furious life in Miami.I really liked this film and would say that, in some ways, it was better than the first.  For one thing, this one seemed to actually have a plot, which was nice, even though it was a really simple one.  For another, the street racing was awesome.  The first race that the movie opens up with is one of the best scenes of the whole movie, but all of the racing sequences are great.  The cars are hot and so are the effects and you feel like you are really gaining speed while you are watching the film.  The special features on the DVD are a little skimpy, but there is a sequence that is worth watching about how Brian made it from California to Florida.  Well worth your time to check out!"								
"2004-02-26	1.0	1	4	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie has set a new degree of boredom for me. Why is it that this year seems to have had a bunch of really bad films. All I can say is that I didn't like this movie at all."								
"2013-12-03	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	If you have purchased the original Fast and the Furious then you know you need the 2nd one. And you might as well by the next four so you can do a Fast and the Furious movie marathon. Makes for a great movie night."								
"2014-02-08	4.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I think it is better than F and F 6 about equal to F and F 5.  I loved Tyrese and Paul Walker's interactions."								
"2007-12-27	4.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie is pretty brain dead, but a fun ride anyway.  It looks and sounds phenomenal on HD DVD--a bit step up from the already decent DVD release.  I now have the other two movies in the series on order on HD DVD."								
"2003-07-01	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	i really liked this just as much as the first the cars again were just as beautiful as they were in the first.i think paul walker is a good actor. even without vin disiel this was still a very interesting plot. i hope they are planning a third and and forth. this is a movie i could watch over and over and not get tried of it.go see it if you like racing and action."								
"2003-10-02	5.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I loved 2 fast 2 furious.  It's better than the first one (it's easier than you think to get over Vin leaving)...the cars are better, the location is better (you can't beat Miami)...Tyrese is great, and he adds a lot of comic value I didn't expect.Much more exciting and fast paced than the first movie.  Better stunts too.I looked at the DVD's extras last night...there was some pretty cool stuff, but the deleted scenes and outtakes aren't too interesting.  I liked watching Ludacris' making of his video, but they didn't have the actual video you could watch, which would have been nice.So it's a great movie with some decent extras."								
"2004-01-04	5.0	7	8	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Wow!  This movie has been getting real mixed reviews .... personally, I am a huge Vin Diesel fan - the man rocks! ... and whilst I love the man, and I am disappointed he wasn't in this sequel, I also thought 2Fast 2Furious was a damn good movie.I thought the storyline was pretty cool actually, people need to take the 'tone' of the movie into account ..... this is about cars, fast cars, hot women, buff men, and essentially tells us what happens to Brian O'Connor (Paul walkers character) after the 'open' ending of the fast and the furious!  Tyrese isn't Vin Diesel but then I don't think they tried to make out that he was! There are absolutely superb action shots and plenty of movement in the plot to make it kick ass.Ummmmmm.... make sure you check out the special features section, cause there is a couple of short films to get you to where we start the movie.I get the feeling that there's gonna be another fast and furious movie coming out, cause I think they're going to get together Vin Diesel, Tyrese, and Paul Walker to finish off the series! That would be most awesome.If you like awesome cars, action, and humour then you won't be disappointed in this movie!  I looooooooove it!  And I'm a chick.To those of you out there who thought it sucked ..... maybe you should watch it again and give it a 'go'.  As in, forget the hype, and just watch the movie.Kristina"								
"2012-04-08	4.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I enjoy watching 2 Fast 2 Furious. I think I like it more then the first Fast and Furious. What I like more about it is the story the movie plays. A little bit more drama. My fav. scene is when they are running from the cop's. They go into a building and a bunch of car's come out to distract the cop's so they can get away."								
"2003-12-13	1.0	1	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie seemed like it took 2 days to write the script.  It begins with the star of the first film Brian O' Conner racing his Nissan Skyline to make some money.  I live in Downtown Miami and there could never be a race around downtown that fast without some driver running over a group of kids or seniors.  The police shoot Paul Walker's car with a ...looking gun and coerce him into going undercover to infiltrate a money launderer/soft gangster named Carter Verone(Cole Hauser).  Brian says he wants a partner, Roman Pearce played by Tyrese.  Why does there HAVE to be actors in movies just because they are somewhat good looking.  The Fast and the Furious was a great movie and this one pretty much erases all the credibilty and respect that the original had.  Paul Walker should have demanded creative control and made sure it did not end up ... LIKE IT DID.  The people that saw this movie in the theatres do not have a life and anyone who enjoyed it is on some kind of controlled substance or alcohol."								
"2003-06-19	1.0	0	7	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	When I read things like ""best movie ever"" and ""better than then the first"" under a movie like 2 Fast 2 Furious it make me well, Furious. This is not the kind of movie anyone should consider their favorite, it pan handles to the audience, merely repeats the first films action (fast cars + trucks = crash) and  dares to go on without Vin Diesel. To say the least the first one was also a steaming pile of hollywood excrament but  this one surely takes the cake on useless and horrible sequels. If you are so sorely in need of seeing cars watch Nascar or for the luv of pete play a racing video game, those two things combined will feed your need for speed without giving into movies such as this. It just seems like movie audiences today have no kind of standards, it appears that they can, will, and do watch anything that comes out."								
"2013-12-20	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie does take place in Miami, Florida, United States, so there should be no surprise that the aesthetics is filled with lots of colors. It serves as a good sequel to The Fast And The Furious. The bickering between Tyrese Gibson(yes, that is Tyrese' s last name) and Paul Walker is hilarious. This time there is more fun-filled car races and other car scenes along with action."								
"2013-04-01	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	this is the 2 movie the ser. i love the movie. u should see the movie if u like fast car and hot guys."								
"2013-06-04	4.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Worth the watch - just good fun to watch Paul Walker and Tyrese mix it up and give us all another good ride."								
"2012-12-02	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I love the whole series of these movies--this one is good tho it would have been better with Vin in it"								
"2014-03-20	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	What can I say that others haven't already?  Who doesn't love all the Fast movies?  Paul Walker grew into this role from the first movie on and was a favorite for all of us.  Vin Diesel?  Loved him from the first and love him still.  If he's in a movie, I'm gonna watch it!  And the rest of the cast adds so much intrigue and fun.  Lastly....I love movies about fast cars, heists, the sorta bad guys getting away with it."								
"2006-12-20	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	THIS MOVIE IS A STAND ALONE. THERE IS NO NEED TO SEE THE FIRST ONE TO FOLLOW THE STORYLINE. TYRESE GIBSON IS IN THIS MOVIE WHAT MORE DO I NEED TO SAY."								
"2003-06-08	5.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Then is must-see fot the summer 03. this movie has everything fast cars,beautiful women,and non-stop action.I think that Tyrese fill the role of Vin diesel nicely. This movie is kick ... all the way. Can't wait for fast and the furious 3. Go check it out this summmer."								
"2004-05-20	3.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 fast 2 furious was indeed good but not so good I mean The reason I went is to see the Nissan Skyline!!!Overal the street racing was cool just to much special effects.Lets get real vipers,corvette,s281 saleen stang cant catch 2 imports?@ imports beatinging up Powerhouse muscle.Dont get me wrong Im a huge import fan but the whole movie doesnt make sense its just loose you from the beginning like whats the whole point.Dont get me wrong the racing is cool but the plot is corny."								
"2011-12-24	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Who hasnt already seen this movie? We all have & we all know that its the weakest link in the fast & furious chain. I only purchased this to satisfy my husband who said we needed it to complete the collection."								
"2014-02-06	4.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I really like this series.  It's almost a young version of the 007 movies.  I gave it 4 stars because it took a while to download - could be my internet, but I don't think it was.  I was disappointed that Vin Damme was not in this one though."								
"2004-02-02	4.0	4	6	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	I am &quot"	NOT&quot	 a MTV person, or a Vin Desil triple X fanatic...but I can honestly say that this sequel is a very good movie.I hated part 1, so I was very surprised by enjoying this movie. The sepecil effects are better!!!! And the racing scenes seem more realistic.If you like fast cars, then you should buy this DVD.						
"2003-11-07	5.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Vin Diesel's missing in action, but is replaced by Eva Mendes! Forget about it cuh, you like 2 eat other people's sandwiches. Brian (Paul Walker) is back and doing the street racing thang in Miami this time around. Ludacris and the daughter of Benihana are in this movie, why? &quot"	2 Fast 2 Furious&quot	 is 2 much for you 2 handle if you're not in2 this kind of movie. Secret agent posing as an evil man's mistress, distrustful! Sun tanning has never been so much fun. Tyrese isn't much of a pickpocketer either!						
"2003-10-14	4.0	1	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Even though this movie is not as good as the first, a car lover is going to like the movie regardless.  Granted, the plot was kinda weak, but you can't go wrong with the even better souped up cars, and an incredibly intense racing scene to start the movie out.  The racing scene was kinda unrealistic, but come on, it's a movie.  Thats's the whole point.  What disappointed me was the 2 cars that were chosen to be the main cars.  They sucked.  Why didn't they use the Nissan Skyline?  That car could have been the nicest and one of the fasted cars I have ever seen.  That car was tight.  They didn't show it enough.  I think the lack of Vin was missed.  I think he really helped make the first movie a good one.  But overall I think this is a must see.  Movies don't have to be realistic.  Life is boring.  That's why we have movies.  For those of you who diss this movie because of its lack of realism or sad plot....shut up.  No one is asking you to watch it again.  At times it is intense and the racing scenes are better with more skilled driving.  Just watch it.  But you don't have to take my word for it."								
"2003-10-18	4.0	2	2	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 Fast 2 Furious is one of a few sequels that is actually better than the first.  This one picks up where the first one left off with Brian O'Connor, now off the police force, drag racing cars in Miami.  After getting caught by the police, O'Connor agrees to help take down a drug kingpin who needs good drivers to help transport ""goods.""  Joining him is his childhood friend, Roman Pierce, who has had a falling out with Brian, but we do not know why.  The thin plot is really just an excuse to show fast cars, beautiful women, and great action, but who cares?  This is a great movie to watch that never slows down from beginning to end.  Just like The Fast and the Furious, this one has great driving sequences, some which remind you of the Blues Brothers, and an overall feel of cool to the whole movie.  The scene where Brian and Roman are trapped by the police towards the end is great as is their Dukes of Hazard jump off a pier.  This is an exciting movie that will keep you interested throughout.Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are very good together as Brian O'Connor and Roman Pierce.  Their friendship is surprisingly believable and much better over the one between Walker and Diesel.  Personally, I think that is the reason this one is better.  Eva Mendes and Devon Aoki are basically eye candy for the movie and look great doing so.  Cole Hauser stars as Carter Verone, the drug kingpin, who unknowingly has been infiltrated by numerous federal agents and police officers. Rapper Ludacris also stars in a very good role as Taj, a former racer who now stays out of the races and organizes them instead.  The DVD offers plenty of very good extras including the widescreen presentation, trailers, deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries, and behind the scenes documentaries.  2 Fast 2 Furious is a fun movie to watch that is even better than the first.  Don't miss 2 Fast 2 Furious!"								
"2010-01-03	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Speed--it's easy to get and it's as close as the nearest set of high-performance wheels. Brian O'Connor, now a disgraced cop, fell victim to it--and now he's paying the price. As far as his bosses and the FBI brass are concerned, the hothead undercover officer threw one of their largest investigations ever. If you are wanting to see a movie with more awesome cars, well this is it. Very entertaining."								
"2005-07-18	1.0	1	3	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	This movie was really bad.. The worst part was when the main character attempeted to use some urban slang. I damn near broke my remote trying to turn it so fast."								
"2014-01-29	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	2 has all been my favorite of all the Fast and the Furious movies great movie check it out :)"								
"2004-01-19	4.0	4	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	In 2001 ""The Fast and the Furious"" was testimony to the unexpected lure of a howling engine, blue smoke from spinning tires, and hot dudes and babes in even hotter cars. Oh yeah, and the moody glower of breakout star Vin Diesel.So what do you do for the sequel? More smoke, babes, dudes and howling. And no Diesel.The result? Well, as expected, director John Singleton (""Boyz N the Hood"") did not make a movie as good as ""FF1."" This is way better.How is it better? Let us count the ways. First, he got rid of all the extraneous stuff -- like plot. ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" has something to do with money and drugs, but Singleton wisely doesn't spend too much time sweating the details. Basically, it boils down to one of two situations: The guys have something and must drive 120 mph to escape with it, or they are after something and must drive 120 mph to capture it.Second, the lumpish presence of Diesel and his biceps is barely missed at all. Like the first version, this film seems to be set up as a star vehicle for blue-eyed, Steve McQueenesque Paul Walker. But once again it looks as if the sidekick walks off with the movie.An actor, rapper and model, Tyrese (as Walker's pal Roman Pearce) brings something new to Diesel's role as the moody, hard-driving loner -- a personality. He's not just buffed and cocky, he's got such a nice way with a one-liner that he grows on you.Like virtually everyone else in the sequel, Tyrese was not part of the original. This is exactly the same movie as the first one except for the fact that almost all the actors have changed, it is now set in Miami instead of Southern California, and a Cuban drug dealer (Cole Hauser of ""White Oleander"") has been added as a villain.The constant is that these are still the sort of hot-wheelers who -- when a 20-foot jump is unexpectedly inserted at the end of a white-knuckle race -- find it to be an exhilarating and amusing development. They sail hundreds of feet through the air hollering ""Whoooooooo!"" at the top of their lungs, and have a good laugh about it at the finish line. (No one gets hurt, of course, despite the lack of helmets, seat belts or parachutes.)The new premise is that Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, has been kicked off the police force and is scratching out a borderline existence in Florida as a street racer. His buddy, Tej (rapper Ludacris, an improvement over Ja- Rule in ""FF1""), runs the garage, finds him races and helps him live the car culture life. Call it ""Boyz Under the Hood.""O'Conner needs money and is offered a chance to make some -- and, of course,clear his name -- on an undercover job with U.S. Customs. In an amazing coincidence, the undercover agent he is working with happens to be a gorgeous brunette (Eva Mendes of ""Training Day""). He also picks up his pal Roman (Tyrese) to help run the scam. And we're off.RIVETING DRAG RACESOne nice touch is that in Miami they are apparently not into that boring, side-by-side drag racing from ""FF1."" This is real street racing with NASCAR- style fender-rubbing and bumper-bumping. There are at least three set pieces in which cars careen through traffic, cutting off semitrailers, skidding across lanes and creating spectacular crashes. It is riveting -- except for those who have driven there, who will recognize it as just another typical day on a Miami freeway.However, it should be said that Singleton does a nice job of keeping the gratuitous violence to a minimum. Nothing says summer film fun like explosions,guns and cartwheeling cars -- and that's all here -- but the gore and mayhem is restrained. The scene you'll be talking about afterward, involving a rat, a bucket and a blowtorch, is especially clever since its effect depends almost entirely on the viewer's imagination, not grisly details.The rest of the action is more likely to spark interest in high-performance racing gear than gunplay.HIGH-SPEED FANTASYThere will probably be a rash of concerned citizens who decry the crazy driving showcased in the film. But the FF movies may be saving the clutch-and- shift car from extinction. (Although someone should point out that there is not a street racer in the world that has a gear that can be engaged at 114 mph to make the car go faster.)At the end, the whole thing makes no more sense than the conclusion, an implausible, pointless, high-speed leap over hundreds of feet of water. But that doesn't mean you won't be hollering ""Whoooooooo!"" all the way."								
"2013-06-27	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	well Amazon did it again,they had the Fast and Furious DVD I needed to bring my collection up to date..now all I have to do is wait for the next two to come out! This is such a good series,I watch it anytime I get a chance."								
"2006-04-30	5.0	2	5	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	hey,does anyone know what the name of the song played in the 2 fast 2 furious trailor/ preview is?"								
"2003-07-27	5.0	1	1	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Paul Walker [was awesome] in this movie. His 500 horsepower twin turbo nissan skyline GTR was off the hook. Paul Walkers Green Mitsubishi Lancer evo and roman's Mitsubishi eclipse spider were also [great]. Definitely A must buy movie. If the first fast and the furious had as big of an impact on your lives as it did on mine then you'll Love this one."								
"2013-09-18	5.0	0	0	2-Fast-2-Furious-(Widescreen-Edition)	Action, love the driving. The actors enter act well. Not a bad story line. Have seen the series except the last one, can't wait for it to come out."								



The idea is to take the average ratings per month and make a graph of this. THis is what the script might look like in this case:
# reference to the review file
reviewFile = "reviews.2-Fast-2-Furious.csv"
# read the reviews as tab-separated values
reviews = read.csv(reviewFile, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, sep = '\t')

# add names to the columns
names(reviews) <- c("date","rating","helpful","total","text")

# interpret column values as dates
reviews$date <- as.Date(reviews$date, "%Y-%m-%d") 
# add month column
reviews$month <- as.Date(cut(reviews$date, breaks = "month")) 
# aggregate mean rating per month
aggr <- aggregate(reviews$rating ~ reviews$month, FUN = mean) 
# add frequency column aggregate per month
aggr$freq = count(reviews$month)$freq 
# add names to the aggr data frame
names(aggr) <- c("month","avg_rating","num_ratings") 

# set up a two-plot graph
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
# plot avg_rating per month
plot(aggr$month, aggr$avg_rating, type="line", xlab="Month", ylab="Avg. rating") 
# plot avg_rating per month
plot(aggr$month, aggr$num_ratings, type="line", xlab="Month", ylab="# ratings") 

But we  are still stumbling with this, it is not working correctly. We have to get some help. And then hopefully we have a graph
with the ratings, and a line which indicates the death. Then we will do this for multiple actors and see if we can make
a conclusion
